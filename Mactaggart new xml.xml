                <p><hw>ABOUT THE BUSS</hw>—About the bush. A very old phrase, signifying, not downright, the way of a mean sculking coward. Thus we say of an honest man, that he never gaes about the buss; he never attempts to cheat, has no doublings to defraud; he makes nae lang wund stories, and whaups i'the rape. No, no; he drives right forward, through bush and brier.</p>

                <p>In that good old Poem, the Cherrie and the Slae, written by Captain Alexander Montgomery, about 1590, and printed by Bob Walgrave, some seven years after, we meet with this phrase respecting the Buss very frequently; as in the 46th verse, when branding dread, danger, and despair, as cowards :</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>“They are mair faschions, nor of Feck,</l>
                    <l>"Zon fazards durst not for their neck,</l>
                    <l>"Clim' up the craig to us.</l>
                    <l>"Frae we determined to dee,</l>
                    <l>"Or else to clim Zon Cherrie Tree,</l>
                    <p>"They bade-About the Buss."-&amp;c.</p>
                </lg>

                <p>And in the 77th verse of the same Poem, it is said of Experience,</p>

                <lg type="verse">
                    <l>"For Authors quha alleges us,</l>
                    <l>"They wad na gae about the buss,</l>
                    <l>"To foster deidly feid, &amp;c."</l>
                </lg>

                <p>In no other author of the Captain's day, nor in any I have seen before him, is this phrase to be met with; and as it is heard used at the present day ten times in Galloway, for once in any other part of Scotland, it may help to prove, that Montgomery was either a native of the country, or well acquainted with its language. It is said he was born in Germany, but that the greater part of his life he passed in Scotland, but where in Scotland, has been a question; various towns and counties claim him. Tradition says he lived at Cummingstown, on the banks <pb n="3" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />of the Tarf-Galloway-now known by the name of Cummstown; this seems very probable, for many reasons, but particularly from passages in his Poem, actually pointing out the natural scenery of this seat of the Cumming. In truth, his muse seems often to have heard the roarin sough of the Doachs o' Tongueland Water.</p>

                <p>ACKAVITY, ACKWAVITY, or ACKWA.-The chief of all spirituous liquors, viz. Whisky, when taken to excess, does not even make such a wreck of the human constitution as others do, such as rum and brandy, and when taken in moderation, as it should be, there is none other half so good. Far be it from me to hold up any thing that may be thought allied to vice; and if whisky be so, as many grave men think, I have little cause to eulogize it, being no great bottle man: nature having given me a frame of body that is a sworn foe to any fluid stronger than Adam's Wine. However, as the majority of men are moulded different, I will say, that a dram o' gude ackwa and cauller-water, refreshes a fainting heart, in a sultry simmer day; and the same quantity o' Farintosh, is quite comfortable to take in a cauld wunter morning, while even a Tumbler or twa o' Toddy, looks social on an evening. So I won't join with M'Neil and others, in saying it is the Scaith o' Scotlan. I am more inclined to side with Burns to a certain extent. Scotland may be very thankful that it is her prevailing drink; as a drink, like every other nation, she must have; the English have their drowzy brown stout, the Turks their opium, the South Sea Islanders their kava; but what brings on a quicker, or a happier intoxication, than the pure Mountain dew? how it exhilirates the soul, how it exposes the sons of men, and shows them in their true colours, be they good, bad, witty, or how; it tries their strength, as itself is tried by <pb n="4" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />specific gravity; letting it be known, the beads they sink or swim. The old song is at this of it:</p>

                <p>"A man whan he's sober is deils ill to ken,</p>

                <p>"Gude sooks than there's nae kenning o' him,</p>

                <p>"But prime him wi nappie than ye mae gae ben,</p>

                <p>"And learn what he is-for 'twill show him."</p>

                <p>Many have whisky to be a slow poison, which, perhaps, it may be, in a certain degree, particularly if any way adulterated. A person told the celebrated Billy Marshall the Tinkler, once, that it was a slaw pizion— "It maun be deils slaw indeed, quoth the Gypsey Chief, for I hae tooted it owre in nogginfus now, for mair than a hunner year, and am tae fore yet hale and fear." He died when 120 years of age.</p>

                <p>And once, a Kirkcubrie carter, having brought some coals to a certain very abstemious medical man, the doctor, according to the custom of the country, presented him with a dram o' whisky for by-payment. The carter drank it off in a moment, making his wee finger twirl above the quickly emptied glass, in fine stile; when, quoth the Doctor, with some emphasis-"That's a nail in thy coffin, Sanders." "May be sae (replied the drunkard)</p>

                <p>I wish it were fu o' sic tackets."</p>

                <p>ADDER-BEADS-Beads made by Adders. Such beads are common now in museums, and other repositories of rarities; they are mostly about the size of a hazle-nut, oval shaped, of an amber hue, but full of specks of other beautiful colours-The hole through them is about half an inch in diameter, and large enough to admit a child's little finger. That the Adders make them,; is never doubted, but how, is as yet never exactly known; the country people say it is gone about this way. Seven old Adders, with manes on their backs, have a meeting in some snug heather bush, before the sun; with them is also a long small white one; operations are begun by the hairy reptiles, <pb n="5" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />putting forth from their mouths a glutinous matter of a honey colour. The white Adder moulds this into a certain shape, forming the hole by creeping through it— and still as it creeps in-through and out-through the matter, the old ones keep salivating it-so the bead is constructed, and left to harden in the sun.</p>

                <p>But (add the peasantry) it is impossible to stand any time, and behold them thus at work in their bead manufactory-as at these times they are full of wrath and swiftness; so that if the observer be seen by them, he has little chance to get off alive.</p>

                <p>For my own part, I much doubt if this operation of the viper hath ever yet been beheld by human eyes; the beads are found in the places where the Adders abound, and no where else; they are found too, in greater or less quantities, according as the serpents are for number; so every thing about them argues they are a production of the Adder, but for what purpose they form them none can tell; the subject, though, methinks, might be dipped deeper into by naturalists than it is. To illustrate it, however, a little farther, I may give the Poem of the</p>

                <p>ADDER O' BALDOON.-Amongst the many traditions of Galloway, appears one, entitled the Adder o' Baldoon, the foundation of which is, that a reptile of enormous size was killed about sixty years ago, on the fertile howms of Baldoon, near Wigtown; it measured somewhere about eight or nine feet in length, and in thickness that of a man's arm. A shepherd traced it out one dewy morning, by the path it had left on the wet grass, and his dog having come up on it beyond a dyke, a dreadful conflict ensued between Collie and our Boa Constrictor; the strong Tyke, however, succeeded in worrying the huge monster, but not until the serpent had stung him so that he died next morning. The herd himself was so panic struck with the scene, that he was never like himsell again; and died soon afterwards; poor fellow, he fancied that it was an <pb n="9" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />Hurchon that Rover had fallen in with at first-little did he expect it was an Adder, and one of such maguitude. Such seems to be nearly the true part of the tale. The stuffed skin of it is yet to be seen, I am told, in some gentleman's museum in that part of the Country. Warm imaginations have made a good deal of the tale though. They give it wings and claws, and finishes a dragon, which was as thick as a corn sack fu'; so the whole becomes good food for bairnies to take during a Forenicht.</p>

                <p>ADDER'S AITH.-What follows is an Adder's Oath</p>

                <p>"I hae made a vow-and I'll keep it true,</p>

                <p>"That I'll never stang man, through gude sheep's woo." So it may well keep it, for it cannot break it. The Adder cannot pour its venom into a wound made by its fangs, through any thing woollen; the wool brushes away the virus; there is some invention in this Aith, ascribed to the viper. It is in vain to take the oath of a man, for instance, who is base, poisonous, and of a reptile nature, for he will break all oaths, and sting as before; but when he is sworn from harming any thing that is not in his power to harm, whether the oath be off or on; then all's well.</p>

                <p>ADDER STANGS.-The peasantry in general think, that the tongue of the viper is its sting; as it comes nearer to their idea of a sting, from its similitude to that of insects; but it is two large projecting teeth in the upper jaw which do the devilry, called fangs; they are rooted in bags of poison, and when the serpent strikes them into any thing, they are pushed back on the same bags, which squeezes the venom out of the valves, to flow down the conducting teeth into the wound; though this be all <pb n="10" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />known to some, many argue in favour of the tongue; that it has witters on it like a fishhuik, and as blue as the main spring o' a watch.</p>

                <p>AIRT O' THE CLICKY.-When a pilgrim at any time gets bewildered, he poises his staff perpendicular on the way, then leaves it to itself, and on whatever direction it falls, that he pursues; and this little trait of superstition is termed the Airt o' the Clicky-the direction of the staff. And townsmen, when they mean to take a trip into the country for pleasure, and are quite careless to what part of it they wend their way, this they decide sometimes in the same way-the fallen stick determines the course to be pursued; and often as much amusement is found this way, as if the chart had been pricked out. But there are few buridan asses which will starve between bundles of hay, not knowing which to turn to-so those generally, who seek direction from the staff, mostly cause it to gravitate toward the place they have a secret inclination to go to.

Is made up in black rolls, about a foot in length, and sold in the grocers' shops; it is much used in breweries; by people troubled with the cough, and by those who have been in the habit of chewing tobacco.

Rustic lovers tell other whiles, that they are as sweet as Alicreesh. In truth, lovers are oft at a loss to find sweet enough comparisons for their darlings: a fellow once would write a letter to the dictation of a lover, and asking, "what he'd break off with," the poor wretch, with the burning heart, repliedSay first, Tam'—“ and in big letters—' My dearest, dearest Henniesuckle."</p>

                <p>ALLAN-HAWKS-A sea-fowl with very small wings, common to be met with on the shores of Britain; its colour is black, all but on the breast, there it is white. I wonder how Edwards, Willoughby, and others, who have treated of British birds, have missed this one in their ornithologies. It is similar to the puffin in size, but it cannot fly; often after storms they are found driven in dead upon shores; whether it is that the storms so agitate the deep, that they deprive them of food, and so they famish amid the waves, or whether by diving on surfy shores they are dashed against the rocks, is not yet known; nor can it be conjectured how they come to have the name of Allan-Hawks.</p>

                <p>ALLAN KINNIGHAM, the poet-Allan Cunningham, Esq. one of the truest poets, and best of men, Scotland has ever given birth to. He was born and bred in Nithsdale, but the greater part of his father's family are Gallovidians, and lived long near the village of Killpatrick. His father was gifted with the rare talent of a poet too, to a certain degree, and wrote many good little things for a magazine, which was published in Dumfries about sixty years ago, by Jackson, printer there; he was an East Lothian man, but the ancestors of the family are found to have belonged to that third division of Ayrshire called Cunningham; they had been there honest millers time out of mind, but took up arms in defence of their dear country when Oliver <pb n="13" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />Cromwell invaded Scotland. The worthy subject of my present little sketch, began to show symptoms of the poet very early in life; he became extremely fond of books, and listened always with a greedy ear to the tales of other days; and the singing of wild ancient ballads, the feeling old cronoch of these thrilled with extacy through his heart; while the charming rural scenery on the banks of the Nith quickened the whole, and winged the imagination for soaring high in the poetic firmament. As to receiving education at school, that was as scanty with him as it ever was with either Burns or the Etterick Shepherd. To men of strong genius, a school is not worth a farthing, a school rather does them more harm than good, unless the dominic allows them to learn whatever they please according to their taste; but the moment they are obliged to alter their course, from that time they are not a guiding a right. For all, where find we a better scholar than Burns, or one to match Cunningham; the memories of such men let nothing slip they have once grasped, and they know more of a book by giving it a careless glance, than others do by reading it three times through with double milled specks on their noses.</p>

                <p>he</p>

                <p>Until our bard came to be about fifteen years of age wrote not on paper any of his little tender aspirations, but from this time he began now and then to try his hand, and a happy sight to him was a few verses in the corner of a Dumfries newspaper; he even went so far as to try to have an insertion in a London Magazine; while thus the days of his boyhood glided away in song making, and labouring at his trade of a mason, Mr. Robert Cromek came into Galloway a legend gathering, and having soon found out our wonderful young bard, they wandered together through all the fairy haunts and warlock glens of the country; and having obtained a wallet-full of very strange matter, Cromek set off with the bag and the nails to London. Mr. Cunningham was invited to follow, and <pb n="14" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />aid the publication of the work, which was the "Nithsdale and Galloway song;" the whole of which almost is the work of our poet; and there he truly shines a poet indeed. What a quantity of pure poetry is in that book. The Mermaid o' Galloway-The Lord's Marie-She's gane to dwall in Heaven-The Lass o' Preston MillMy ain Countrie, and many other songs in it, are perfectly exquisite, the ancient-like mould in which they are cast, their strong originality and feeling natural touchescharm every Scotch mind, while the gentle melancholy that tinges them all, finishes them off in a manner so beautiful, that when we read them we neither think ourselves nor this earth, such gross things as they be, but we have entered, or about to enter, some kind of elysium. After the publication of that book, in which he shines so gloriously, he became a constant writer in a London newspaper; but something going wrong in the management of this paper, he laid down his pen like a true philosopher, and stood by his trade of the hammer. But a man of great merit, honesty, and industry, will be taken by the hand, so our bard received a situation under the celebrated sculptor, Mr. Chantry; and this situation he yet holds, beloved by his master and by all who have the pleasure of knowing him. For Mr. Cunningham is not only a poet and an enthusiast about poets and poetry, of the very first kind, but he is also a man extremely cheerful in society, kind every where, and liberal to the last degree; he is one of those few men who conduct themselves in such a manner that we do not see any of their faults; he is open and free, hides nothing, dashes ona Scotchman every inch; we see Caledonia in him; in every look, in every move, he makes: he gives his native language its truest swing; the words flow from him with the greatest ease, and with a manly pith. Sometime ago Blackwood, the Edinburgh bookseller, would have him to become a writer to his magazine; he did so, and <pb n="15" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />produced therein "Mark Maccrabbin, the Cameronian," a very able and singular production; but some misunderstanding taking place between that bookseller and him, he withdrew his valuable pen, and wrote for a London magazine; the articles inserted there he has since taken out and published in two volumes, the tales of which are very wild, poetical and original.</p>

                <p>Also lately he has published a drama, named "Sir Marmaduke Maxwell," full of passion and poetry; and a wild legend, termed "Richard Faulder;" these have been highly praised, even the "great unknown"-the Laird of Abbotsford-hath publicly lauded both them and their author. At present he is preparing two volumes of Scotch songs for the press; and as far as I am aware has dipped deeper into the nature and worth of these songs than any writer hath yet done. Cunningham beats up game in a country, different from that of either Burns or Hogg; he is not such a mannerest as the first, nor such a fairy man as the last; his melancholy is of a solemn, sombre cast, not like Burns, flaming in the vortex of passion; nor like Hogg, dancing lightly and wildly round the halos of the moon; he has a place between themplace untouched and unpolluted, for such a situation, a religious cast of a rare kind was necessary, and this Mr. Cunningham has in an eminent degree; it is a poetical religion, felt by some of the covenanters when they assemble on the wild breckany brae, beneath the blue canopy on a Sabbath morning.</p>

                <p>To conclude, though I may add to the biography of him, that he has been married now to a worthy, pleasant woman these several years, from Galloway, and they have a good many bairnies; that he himself is a strong, hardy man, above six feet in height, swarthy visage, with pleasant features, his eyes and eye-brows bespeak great intellect; with all men of genius of the day he is intimate,</p>

                <p>with Sir Walter Scott, Wordsworth, Wilkie, Irving, &amp;c. <pb n="16" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />and that they all are pleased with the friendship of Cunningham.</p>

                <p>So, therefore, be my thoughts briefly stated respecting this gifted individual. If I have said any thing wrong, I shall be sorry-if I have said too much in his favour, then I am happy-for to say too much to his praise is a thing impossible; he is a subject that would not disgrace the best, the strongest pen that ever was wielded, and he who thinks I am a flatterer knows nothing of the character of Mactaggart.</p>

ALLICOMPAIN.-Enula Campana, the medical plant; the Elecampain of materia medica; truely the root is a useful thing in medicine, but my famous "Yirbwives” which shall afterwards be spoken of, think it an antidote almost against every distemper that inflicts either body or mind; so it is common in many rural gardens; beside it, is generally set a sun-dial, and the rustics are often seen wondering at the two wonders, a thing poetic to see.

                <p><hw>AN'RO GEMMLE</hw>-I cannot say, neither can I find any who can, whether this famous Andrew, this notable mendicant, or Gaberlunzie-man, was a native of any of the parishes of the South or no; be that as it may, however, sure it is, that he made them one of his favorite begging tracks, and was generally to be found in some "neuk o' Gallowa or anither."</p>

                <p>He was a strong tall Carle, and had served in the army in the capacity of a dragoon; he was always called "The King of the Beggars," as well he might, for he not only begged himself, but had numbers of beggar wives who ran the country and begged for him; he supplied them with mealpowks," appointing always on Monday mornings, when they "broke off" the "howf," they should meet at next Saturday night, and she who brought him the most meal, became his favorite sultanna for that time, turning off those who made small returns, and taking the Powks from them.</p>

                <p>He was of a" crazed nature," like every old soldier who hath seen much blood, and when any little thing curled his temper, he became a madman complete; he boasted of his prowess at the fireside game of " dams,” alias drafts, and whenever his antagonist was like to be too deep for him, he took the "men" of the "brod" and dashed them in the fire with a vengeance. He was very fond too of playing off little jeux d'esprits of his own formation. Once, as a priest was going to his church on the Sabbath day to hold forth, he espied An'ro on the road a little before him, seemingly in the most profound meditation, pondering deeply with "leaden eye that loves the ground," something lying in the way, and stepping seriously round it. The clergyman came up, and seeing the object of his wonderous gaze, said, "Well, An'ro, what's this that seems to be puzzling you so? for my part I see nothing but a horseshoe on the road." "Dear me, returned the Gaberlunzie, <pb n="20" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />with uplifted hands, what disna that lair do, I hae glowrd at that shoe now the best part o' hauf an hour, and deil take me gif I cud say whether it was a horse-shoe or a mare-shoe." This is Walter Scott's-Eddie Ochiltreeonly he was not a "Bluegown."</p>

                <p>ARK O' THE CLUDS-or Noah's Ark. The various forms the clouds assume in different seasons, are very attractive to the eye of man; that one mentioned in scripture, which rose out of the sea like a man's hand, soon changed its shape. The famous Dean Swift thought he would be a <pb n="21" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />clever fellow if he could tell what shape a cloud would be in when it set in the east, by seeing it rise in the west; ere they cross the canopy of heaven, they fling themselves into numberless figures, whiles they are one thing whiles another, and whiles "very like a whale," as Shakespeare says. But there is no conglomeration of the clouds, no figure they assume and hold by longer without changing, than this called the ark, or Noah's ark, a description of its appearance I shall attempt to give. In the winter season (for the ark is not common in any other), when the sky is clear and weather frosty, curious light grey clouds in the shape of ribs will oft arise from a point in the horizon, and stretch over the sky to its opposite on the other side; these cloudy ribs narrow in bulk towards the horizon, and are at the widest right over our heads, or in the zenith. "If great things can be compared to small," as Milton says, I would liken this figure of the clouds to the half of a cocoa-nut shell split lengthways, or a Norway yawl, in this form will it appear for a day together, and even longer; what is singular too we have no half arks, the one half never sinks beneath the horizon and leaves the other half above; we have the scene always in perfection, or we have it not at all; we have it as if it was calculated to appear in our latitude and longitude, and in no nations else; for it begins to form, comes to perfection, and vanishes away, all in our canopy; we may therefore say there are arks for every country.</p>

                <p>When seen in frosty weather, as it generally is, watherwise fowk prognosticate a thaw instantly, attended wi' an awfu spate, to the gnawing grief of the keen veteran curler, who cries out yonders the curse that drowns the chanlestane, and cuts the head and feet frae bonspiels. To be short, the ark is a great thaw sign, and brings commonly with it enough of water. It is from its appearing somewhat in the form of a boat, and from its being attended by a deluge, that it has been termed the ark.</p>

Thus few gourmands are very fat, they eat themselves out of ply; that is to say, over-do themselves with eating. Crows in harvest are very light in body, because they have too much food; and in dead of winter, when it is not so, they are fat; eating much more than enough to satisfy nature is an abominable thing-far rather be a drunkard than a glutton, the latter is the most beastial of the two.

                <p>AULD MILLHAW. An old man of the name of Sproat. He lived at a place called Millha, in the parish of Borgue; and so his name became Auld Millha. He was a great railer against modern manners, and a praiser of the days of his youth. As a specimen of his mind, I give here the "Lamentations o' Auld Millha."</p>

                <p>"Dear me, but fourscore years mak an unco odds o' the times, and that's about as lang as I can min' ought now. Mony an up and down in the warl has haen Auld Millha, and there's a queer something comes owre him whan he claps his auld bum down on the mossaik by the cheek o' the chaumer door, and begins to think awee and glowre back.—There's no a human cratur drawing the wun o' life now that I ken'd in my young days; they're a'i'the mools lang syne; the last ane wha I min' o' that waded about i'the burns wi me whan a boy, and neiv'd beardocks, was Wullie Coskery, and he's gane to his lang hame aboon hauf a dizzen year sin. Wullie was ay but a pieferin useless body a' the days o' him, and ken'd about little but how to mak beeskeps, and wattle saughcreelsthan he wad hae glaiber'd about the splittin o' breers for the hale o' a lang forenicht i'the wunter time, without wearyin.- -Wattie Bennoch was gane afore him. Wattie and me had mony a day o't thegether, but he was ane clever cheil, and as sharp as a preen. We gaed awa ance-it's langsinsyne now-wi a wheen nowt, tae South o' Englan, and as we war gaen by a bit on the road they ca'd (let me think), ay, they ca'd, now when it comes cross me, Templesorby, out came a meikle bill dog frae a tannaree, and was beginning to fley our drove, when Wattie <pb n="26" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />drew his gude hazle rung frae neath his coat-tail, and hit him a whap wi't aneath the lug, till goth he gaed heels owre gowdy without a bough. But some o' the townfolks gat scent o't, and out they cam bizzin like bees, to ding Wattie and me to the deil. I laid on, and sae did he, till some o' us a' hech'd again. We gat out amang them tho' at last wi sair banes; but gin we hadna been a pair o'gye strang rouchtous, we wad hae lain like the thick-nosed collytyke that day.</p>

                <p>"Dear me, what an unco alteration there is now-that auld scrunted hawthorn there afore me, adist the dyke whare the flecket pyets charkin on, and me, are about an age, coming fast up or sliding down the figures 9 and the 0-Folk are no now ava as the war langsyne; they're puir shilpet craturs the best o' them. I hae seen the day I wad hae pulled ony o'm aff their doups at the sweertree. Auld Millha laments to see them. I cud hae shorn ance too man. O! I cud hae sweeped it down, spread mysell laigh on the rigg, and gaen up the lan' scrieven. There warna mony i'the days cud hae kemped wi Auld Millha. My theebanes war then like milltimmers, and my fingers like dragtaes. O! I cud hae open'd out an awsome brisket; I was fit for baith sock and sythe; rid han'd, nae wark cam wrang to me.</p>

                <p>"O! for the days again whan I was young. I kenna what the cheels about twenty are gude for now ava; they want the heart someway athegether; they canna take ae dram o' liquor now, without haeing as mony mimins and prieins to gang through as if they war a' born gentry. Langsyne I hae kend Tam Maʼmin and me cowpin owre a dizzen bumpers o' strang Holland gin, rare smuggled stuff, down at the Brighousebay, in the wee while o' a forenicht, and never giein a kink either owret or aftert.</p>

                <p>"It's a pity to see them, a pity faith-the warls fast degeneratin; baues now are as frush as the branches o' an <pb n="27" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />auld daezd plaintree; the folk hae nae intimmers, as they were wont to hae, ava.</p>

                <p>"Wullawuns and its come to this o't-Hizzies gaen spangin and flaiperin about wi white muslin frocks on, wha in my younger days wad hae been glad o'a piece hame-made stuff, or drogget, and nae bonnet ava; whereas they hae bonnets now co'erd wi gumfloors; and O it was bonny to see the yellow-haird lasses coming happin owre the kirkstyle on a simmer Sunday, wi that laugh o' luve they gaed in every look. Than they war sae healthy and rosey in thae days by what theyre now. There was never a lass but ane, I think, in my kennin, wha dee'd o' a wastin, and she was ane o' the name o' Tibbie Mitchell, a bastard bairn o' ane Girzy Mitchell's, wha wond in the Tannimaws. (The doctors said it was o' that she dee❜d, tho' it was whusherd that it was wi takin owre heavy drinks o' the sap o' the savingtree-to keep a wee scraichin sinner frae seeing the light o' day). There was nae tea amang them in thae days-nane o' that vile spoutroch sae meikle sloated owre now-a-days-na, na, we had nae jabblin thing like scaud ava to sipple wi; but milkporritch, sowings, and sic like glorious belly-timmer-famous swatroch, man; noble stiveron.</p>

                <p>"Whan we pang'd our pechans wi sic like, there war nae asthmas or cruchlins ever heard o'; we cud hae hunted the fox roun Cairnhattie, without a turn'd hair being seen on our heads, and putted a stane, fifty pun weight I dare say, near hauf a mile; ane wad hae thought The lasses get nae men now sic as the are either, young as they gat langsyne; deil a hizzy, gin she had leuked ony think like marryin ava, but wad hae got somebody, or she wan to twenty; hut now they gae by thratty, and mony a ane bids fareweel to matrimony, and curses the men athegether, on the borders o' forty.-Sad wark, man— Hoch anee.</p>

                <p>"A new set o' folk is coming about me athether now,wha talk about plowin and middinmakin; gin they be allow'd to come in amang us as they hae been, we'll be herried out o' house and ha in a crack, for they say they can afford sic rents for the lairds, and can manage a grun sae and sae. I dinna like them ava: I wuss they wad a gae wa the road they cam-awa by the Dinscore or Mochrum-and fash us douce bodies nae mair wi' their glaiberin nonsense</p>

                <p>"I hae seen the days whan there war nae carts wi' wheels in a' the parish, nor harrows wi' airn teeth, but carrs and harrows wi' teeth o' whunroots, and yet we did full weel for a'; had ay rowth to eat and drink and smiok amang o' the best of things. Them wi' their thrashing-machines, airnpleuchs, and turnipbarrows, mere falderaloes, ripin up a' the bits o' green hoams, and forcing wheat to grow whar Providence never intended it, and a' for the lairds, the tennant bodies are never a babee the richer o't; awa wi' yer nice agriculture, yer game laws, and yer Madeira wines-Borgue disna lang for a sight o' themHowt's no</p>

                <p>"Never turn, gentle Borgue, or thou'llt gang a' to the bumwhush; stick by the creed o' thy forefathers, never laugh at the gude auld law.———</p>

                <p>"Dear me, but it makes my heart sair-to see things chynged and chyngin sae far frae their ancient wont. There's nae courtin gaen on now amang the burnbraes, the glens, and aneath the soughin hawthorns-na, na-the primrose, the bludifinger, and the crawtae grow unsqueez'd and unlooked at; the mavis and the yellow-nebed blackburd, let them sing now as they will, they are never heard. How't tow't, there be nae meetings now on a snug barn mow to pass a night. Burnies too maun a rin anither gate now frae what natur intended; lochs too are a' drained-wild-ducks hae nae wallees now to guddle in, ane can hardly get a bit dub for a chaunlestane rink</p>

                <p>"Hech how, there's nae fun ava now amang the fowk; they're a' grown as serious as our auld minister wont to be at a sacrament; nae meetings at ithers ingles to sing sangs, and tell divertin tales; nae boggles now to be seen about Hell's-hole and the Ghaistcraft; nae witch wives about the clench, nor warlocks about the Shellin Hill o' Kirkaners. How't no-what's the folk guid for; the Dei'l has crossed their een with his club, or else Peggy Little, the gillwife, has broke some charm wi' her rowantree beetle or kirustaff.</p>

                <p>"Fairies and brownies hae fled Borgue athegether now; even a dousy beggarbody, wi' a snug sheepskin-wallet and pikestaff, is now to be seen. The folk are a drownin themsells in trackpots and teabroe, fiykin wi' cups and saucers and peutrin about nothing; there's no a chiel worth a doit amang them but some ane or twa, there be nane worth a tinkler's tip-pence.</p>

                <p>"O! for the days again whan I brew'd and sell'd yill at the Saughligget; thae war days, but they're gane now, and Borgue will ne'er see the like o' them</p>

                <p>"But its foolish in me to lament and fret mysell sae about things; short maun may be my time o' the warl now; soon shall I be carried heels foremost out o' that auld biggin, and laid a gude Scotch ell aneath the mools o' the lane kirk-yard; my family is a' there afore me, a' but ane, and he's awa by the Ingies.

                <p>AULD MILL O' MOCHRUM.-There are few men in Scotland who are fond of hearing news and curious things, who have not heard of the Auld mill o' Mochrum; any person who seems to want something obviously, is said to be like this mill, for she has a want also, which art could scarcely supply, which is a back door; now all mills. should have a door of this kind, and because she cannot have one is, that her back is built against a blue solid rock. Also this mill is used to fling out the inquisitive; thus, if a person be met on the road, and asked at "where going," to the "auld mill o' Mochrum" is frequently the reply; so the auld mill o' Mochrum is used in the west the same as the auld kirk o' Dinscore in the east, and makes the forward blush. "Whar do ye live whan ahame," quoth a countryman in the Gallwaygate, Glasgow, to another whom he had just sold an horse, "Ken ye whar the auld kirk o' Dinscore is," was the reply-" ay,” returned the other, "wi than," said the next. The poor farmer inquired about the said auld kirk till he was wearied out, and satisfied that he had been hoaxed of his horse.</p>

                <p>AULD MORTALITY.-This was a man of the name of Thomas Paterson, and was born and bred, as I am told, <pb n="31" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />in the parish of Baulmagie, one of our Galloway parishes; there are living yet many hundreds who personally knew him, of the people of these parts; he was of this world before my time of marking any thing; yet I am acquainted with some of his relations, particularly with a lovely young woman, Miss Paterson, his niece; whether he served a regular apprenticeship to the stone-cutting or carving trade, or took it up at his "own band," as the saying is, cannot now be known; but it would seem the latter way is nearest the truth, as he never was very dexterous at the art, his letters are always clumsy and ill-shaped; frequently too, the words are divided when the margin of the stone intrudes, and even some of his lines are interlined. The honest "Kintrafowks" are at no loss to tell the "wark o' Tamous Paterson" from that of another's, when they meet with it in kirk-yards, whether it is on a "Throuch or a head-stane."</p>

                <p>He was a singular enough character, and well deserving the attention of Sir Walter Scott's mighty genius, and, perhaps, there is not a finer piece of writing, fraught with every thing beautiful and charming, in the many darling volumes written by that wonderful author, as his description of Auld Mortality, at the beginning of the "Tales of my Landlord;" the potent penman has given that detail of him a melancholy poetic tinge, which causes the engraver to touch our affections in a twinkling.</p>

                <p>Then he has drawn him almost exactly to the truth; the licence he has used with him is small; just as he says, he wandered about the country amongst the kirk-yards, with a little white shelty, cleaning and taking a parental charge of the martyrs stones, viz. those martyrs of the covenant whom Scotland stood by, and saw butchered by a set of lawless and base courtiers, to her eternal disgrace! wherever he found these stones, whether on wild moors or lonely kirk-yards the fogg he scoured neatly of them, and renewed their inscriptions with his chisel.</p>

                <pb n="32" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

                <p>But this engrossed only a small part of his trade, as he plied his tools to all who employed him, stopping at night in any decent farm-house that came in his way, for being of a religious turn of mind, he was made welcome almost every where, and kindly treated by the inmates, more particularly too by the Hillfowk, for the care he took in preserving the memories of their glorious brethren; he seldom carried a bag or wallet with him, as the writer of the famous tales says, wherein was his tools for working with; no, I am firmly told he had rarely, if ever, such a thing; but an old chisel in his pocket, and for a mallet to strike with, he used a "Whunstane" for common, picked up about where he intended to work; these stones are yet to be found in burial-grounds, hollowed out a good deal on one side, by striking the head of the carving implement; so to be minute-he often would weep when labouring on a martyr's stone, the cause of this may be understood, without it being told. in Kirkandros kirk-yard, in the south of the parish of Borgue, and is there yet, which he was often beat with to clean, the inscription so overpowering his feelings by conjuring up before him the following inhuman truth :—</p>

                <p>And there was a stone</p>

                <p>"In the days of that infernal persecution of the innocent and independent covenantors, taylors had the clothes of both males and females to make among the common folks, there were no mantua-makers concerned with the rural natives in these times, and the women had a fashion of having pieces of lead about different points of their dresses, to make these points gravitate, in what was then considered the bon mode; so the sons of the thimble' were obliged to have always plenty of this metal about them, that they might go on with their trade, and supply their customers:</p>

                <p>"One of these taylors fell unfortunately into the hands of a party of Grier o' Laggs men, as he was going to one of his houses to work, and these blood-suckers. finding <pb n="33" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />lead in the pockets of the poor fellow, they instantly charged him, that he was going to cast bullets with it.</p>

                <p>In vain did the lad deny the charge, and still in vain did he implore them to mercy; then and there they bound a napkin on his eyes, and shot him through the heart. O! Hell, you contain no villains greater than these!</p>

                <p>But let me cling close to my present subject:-Auld Mortality liked a dram by a time, like many another honest mau, and often would have come to my grandfather's house at Conchieton, in the gloaming, pretty glorious; and one night, as he was wandering through Annandale, with his old shelty, he took too much of the "Cratur,” which "doiter'd" him, and made him lose his way; and having wandered on until he and his companion became quite exhausted, he alighted off the back of his faithful comrade, for the last time, and betook himself to a quarryhole for shelter, and there, with the fatigue and the "nappie," he fell asleep-no more to awake in this world for a stormy night of sleet came on, and the cold froze the warm blood in the heart of Auld Mortality; but his memory shall not perish; it has got a famous heazie already; and should this unvarnished sketch of mine do any good to it, by way of a test, I shall always feel happy.</p>

                <p>BAA-A word used in lulling a babe to rest. In the old song of Rocking the cradle, "hushie baa babie lye still" is a line much used; it is a very musical word, baa; I have heard nurses give it a melancholy cadence, that I have weeped to hear them. Beggar wives with infants at the breast know well the value of the word, and can twang it up on so many mournful keys, that it thrills a good awmous from the hardest heart.</p>

                <p>BABBLES-What may be considered foolish nonsense, though they often turn out to be facts, and facts sometimes babbles. When we hear of a bonny lassy, or a virtuous lad going astray in the paths of rectitude, we exclaim howts babbles, though we believe in the truth of it at the same time. Babbles may therefore be said to be nonsense, yet admitting of doubts, to be truth.</p>

                <p>BACKEN-That space of time between harvest and winter-the back-end of the year as it were many a farmer leaves pieces of work in spring and the summer, to be done in the backen; but when that period arrives, they are still left undone, perhaps till the next waurtime: thus, bad jobs are put off till the last; nor do these little procrastinations do much harm for all. Gallovidians love to be contented; they are naturally so; they dislike to be pushed and hurried, and to make the warle a' faught. They are never very rich in money, nor yet very poor; have enough for the necessaries of life, even in a civilised state; enough for the back and belly, and something of an overplus whiles to help one another in straits; so, what more, ye philosophers, I would ask, is a wanting for the enjoyment of this world?</p>

He wont to be "bamfin aff the heads" wi' Collier Briggs whiles, and they under close reefed tapsails. Seldom ever was he out any long voyage with his boat, but the "wather bruik" on him, or he got back: once going into Ramsay-bay, in the Isle of Man, the "wather bruik” on him, and "dog a bit," (as he told the story), there came a sea ow're the whurrie's quarters, and sweeped his hat and wig wi't; sae he had to spread his sea-coat, in the "sternsheets," to keep out the sea, while he steered the “whurrie” into Ramsay, wi' a" pirnie on his pow."</p>

                <p>John was an oddity, and told strange tales; when it happened he was telling one, and any thing made him lose the "thread," he always referred to the wife to set him right again, by inquiring at her, "Whar was 1, Meg." Meg knew all his tales, the greater part of which were lies; but, by his telling them long, he came to think them truths.</p>

                <p>John was a celebrated country fiddler in his day, and his tunes are very popular.-The life and character of this being, drawn fully out, would form a diverting book.</p>

                <p>BAREFIT-Barefoot; schoolboys, particularly in the country, strip off shoes and stockings, "whanere the harrows begin to trot," and put them not on again, till the hinharrest time; indeed, many of them are so hardy, as not to shod their feet the year round. I have seen them slide on ice barefit, and wade through snow to the knees; and I have followed their example for fun whiles myself, and found it not so cold as fancied: also, I have run barefit with them through "Rossen's o' Whuns, after burds."</p>

                <p>BAR FOR BAR-The game of rhyme; Gallovidians are so fond of clink, that they have a game with it, and a strange one it is truely, when thought of: two or three, and sometimes more, amuse themselves with it, to dinnle awa the time, as they say. One of the players invents a line, the next that follows must give one to clink to it, and have a little sense also; a third follows, and on so those who can hold out longest, and clink best, gain the game, and are allowed by all for that heat to have most of the poet in their composition.-</p>

                <p>BARNIEWATER-What a number of original characters has this Galloway, at one time and another bred; it is a perfect nest for them, not two of the country folks being found any way similar to other; nature so sports herself in the formation of them, that she moulds no pair alike. In towns she casts thousands with one caum," but in a wild rural country, she uses a new caum at every cast, and what rude grotesque creatures she whiles will produce: one of these, to an eminent degree, was Barniewater.</p>

                <p>He was of the name of Livingston, but was always named Barniewater, from a moor-farm, in the parish of Girthon, which he many a day was the tenant of. It was there where he made a considerable sum of money, and first presented his originality to the world. With this cash he purchased a little estate of the name of Grobdale, not far from the famous fountain of Lochenbrack, and there he died, a few years ago, a very old man. His hair hung down his back as white as a "lintstraik," and his eyes looked out from beneath his hat, in that sly shrewd manner which bespeaks no common intellect.-He was naturally very fond of money, so that some went the length to greed made him lift mair than his ain whiles." I am inclined to doubt this-for it is always the case when a person gets rich in a place where no others can, that he is branded with the epithet of being dishonest; now, it is true that Barniewater scraped a good deal of cash out of one of the most barren sterile places that can well be fancied-where only rocks, moss-hags, clints, garries, gall, and heather were to be seen-in a place where no animal of farm-stock kind could live; even the goat had much ado to exist on it in the heart of summer; yet for all, what <pb n="46" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />will industry and care not overcome. When he went to a' market or fair, for instance, he eluded those roads whereón were fixed toll-bars-he paid for no whisky-he was at no expence he was always plotting the best method of evading it; so saved much in this little way, which many others. did not</p>

                <p>In coming to Kirkcudbright, he was always pestered with the Tongueland toll-bar, in his way; but he left his horse before he came through it, and walked on foot to the town and back, though a walk of four miles, to save two-pence-and this he did to the last of his days; old age could not alter his rigid economy. To behold him, mounted on his old shelty, was truely a laughable scene, the animal being always so lean-a perfect "rickle o' banes," and the saddle a goat-skiu, by way of "suggan," with stirrups worn to mere skeletons in their way—.</p>

                <p>Before he got a wife, he rummaged the whole country in order to find one: wherever he heard of a woman being in the matrimonial market, there was he, and there did he treat with themselves or their parents about striking a bargain, as if they had been brute animals. Love was never felt nor spoke about he would have said, "that he had the farm of Barniewater-his name was Livingstonablins, they had heard o’him—he had a gude deal o' sillar, sax or aught score o' gates, and about as mony black-faced sheep, and of course he expected that the wife wad bring him something equivalent."</p>

                <p>Thus went he on for a long time, and all the girls of Galloway became acquainted with him, yet he found few willing to treat with him about a match: at length, he brought one so near the point of closing, that he would allow her five minutes to make up her mind whether she should have him for a husband or not.--The short space of five minutes soon fled, and she agreed to wed Barniewater; she brought him something like an equivalency too, and <pb n="47" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />a "sonsy" daughter, as a "luckpenny," in a short time after—.</p>

                <p>This daughter, being bred in a wild moorland region, where few of her kind she ever met with, except her strange parents, the lassie became extremely wild, ran like a hare, and hid, if she had seen any human being approach the house——.</p>

                <p>Her father was prevailed on by some person to send her to a boarding-school awhile, to get some education; he took her to Dumfries, for that purpose, and had much ado in leaving her behind him: she clung by his coat-tails, and "scraich'd" out as if she had been a creature from the shores of Nootka Sound, or some such out-of-the-way place, and at night she set up a horrible howling. Next morning, betimes, she took to her "scrapers," as the Irish phrase it, and skelped home in a crack, on the "light side of her foot," to Barniewater—.</p>

                <p>She was troubled no more with a boarding-school, or indeed any other kind of school but that of nature, and has turned out to be one of the cleverest females, both in mind and body, as is in the country: she could ride the wildest young horse that ever "lap" bare-backed, with nothing on its head but a "cowd hair halter;" this she would do not "saddle to side," as women ride, but "leg on every,” as the men do and for working amongst sheep, there was not a herd so good in her neighbourhood; she would have brought the goats off Cairnsmoor too in grand stile, running up and down precipices as quick as them. But whether she "gather'd wide," as many thought her father did, it becomes not me to say. I have taken her father's part, that he was not in reality such a person as was suspected, and I shall stand by it, though report is flat against me, that the mark he knew his flocks by, was the mark of "rounstowing," that is, cutting off the ears altogetherthat he flung his marches open to his neighbours' sheep, <pb n="48" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />and when they came upon his land, he "rounstow'd” their ears, which was doing away with all other marks, and so getting them to become his property.This character wade him be disliked by his neighbours, and there were often serious broils between him and them. One of these affairs, with a farmer of the name of Clark, came before a court of justice, and can be found told at great length, in the Dumfries newspapers of that time: the law went against Barniewater, and he and his wife were put in gaol some time about it</p>

                <p>And my opinion is, that he was badly used in that concern. The affray took place on a Sunday afternoon, to be sure, which was not a right thing: but this Clark met him and his wife, taking a walk on that day, and insulted them with tales of "rounstowing," which, no one could say was actually true, which stuff roused Barnie's wrath, and he and the wife gave the insolent fellow a laughable drubbing.</p>

                <p>Barniewater was a creature of patience, perseverance, and good nature; he never keep'd company with those whom he termed " debush'd curses," but sober plodding souls, like himself, were his favourites. He had a custom, as all moor-farmers have, of throwing the bones they pick, over one of their shoulders to their dogs in waiting: he was taking his dinner somewhere, and behind him on the wall hang a looking-glass; he threw a bone smack over his shoulder, which sent the mirror to pieces. To pay the damages, pleased him ill, but he had to cash out, much against the inclination—</p>

                <p>Such was a very rare being-was one writing a novel, he could be done some justice to; whereas, in short sketches of this kind, it is difficult to lay him so before strangers, that they may behold him as he was. To know a person well, one must hear him often speak-know how his pulse beats on various occasions-and so get glimpses, <pb n="49" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />as it were, of the interior of the bosom-with some knowledge of what goes on in the pericranium. BARNMAN'S-JIG-This is a dance which those persons</p>

                <p>have who thrash with the flail. The swoople on the end of the hand-staff being whirled round on the barn-floor by the barnman; every wheel he gives it, he leaps over it, and so produces a very singular dance, worth walking a mile to see, yet few of the barriers who do this dance in stile, are willing to perform before spectators. The girl who kaves the corn is the only one for common who is gratified with the sight. I once insisted on an Irishman, whom I was told was good at it, to let me see; but all I could insist availing nothing, he got angry, and exclaimed-" Hoch, by the frost, don't bother me-I won't give a spring at this time; you may as well whistle jigs to a mile-stone."</p>

                <p>BAULDY CORSON-What an original character was Bauldy; sometimes called Serjeant Corson; he was a native of Galloway, and could boast of having not a little high born-blood in his veins-but, as Pope says,</p>

                <l>"That ancient, but ignoble blood,</l>
                <l>"Has creep'd through scoundrels ever since the flood."</l>

                <p>For this our hero cared nothing; in learning and dissipation he passed his youth, and before he was twenty, enlisted into a regiment of militia, called the Buccleughs, in honour of that worthy Scottish family of Buccleugh. In it he did not long remain as a private, for his genteel address and bewitching manner, soon had him adorned with a sash, and furnished out as a serjeant; such a person as Bauldy soon caught the eye of his commander, the Duke, for though not a tall man, his figure as a soldier was great, and his natural talents of the first rate; he was advanced again to the high post of a recruiting serjeant, and sent with a party of good looking privates, into the towns and country places of Scotland, to enlist the unwary.</p>

                <pb n="51" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

                <p>And never was there a character better cut out for his station than he, and seldom ever was there need for such characters as he, at that time, when all the continental world growled around us, threatening an invasion every day; he possessed as it were, every property that can be supposed qualifications for the office; he could give a damn with singular bravado; he was a blackguard of great grace, and drank whisky after a most enticing manner. The cock of every company he was in; the head-man of every party. At fairs, and other public gatherings, what fascinating speeches and harangues did he not make at the drum-head; those who before had an ́utter abhorrence of a military life, just leap'd at the bounty; then he was as good at keeping his recruits' as he was at enlisting them; when any desertions took place, none were found so capable of ferreting them out as the serjeant; if he was beat with finding them, they were bid fareweel to cheerfully; when Bauldy, the sly hound, was let slip on them, the game was almost sure to be caught; he was often obliged, in this service, to traverse the greater part of the three kingdoms. What tales he had about catching those run-aways, starting them, perhaps, out of some den in the dark Cannongate of Auld Reekie, then following in view over Berwick-upon-Tweed, and afterwards het fit to London; or if they had taken the westerly range it was all one to the serjeant; he'd cross Stranegower; post after them through Green Erin, and hook them up in the devil's own city, Dublin. But whisky and debauchery fairly taking the upperhand of him, he was obliged to turn tail on the regiment, retired into Galloway, and took to himself a rib. Still, however, his friend the Duke, could not altogether lose sight of him, but got a birth for him in the Customs, viz. that of a Tide waiter's. While in this situation he played the devil with the smugglers all along the shores of Solway Firth; he discovered all their dens for secreting contraband goods; nothing could go beyond <pb n="52" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />his craft; he fairly cowd the gowan, as the saying is. On hearing, once, of the arrival of a smuggling lugger at Port Mary, away he posted, in order to learn what had become of the cargo, but knowing this not to be altogether an easy matter, he had recourse to the following stratagem.</p>

                <p>Having put himself under a garb of disguise, he went running with great haste into one of the smuggler's houses, and cried out amongst a bevy of their wives who were assembled, "That the hale o' the Corbies o' the Customhouse war within less than a mile o' the Burnfit, and that if they did na set too instantly, and hide every thing better than it was hidden, they wad fin' the haleware in a twinkling."</p>

                <p>The which intimation created no small stir amongst them, thinking the informant to be one of their well-wishing neighbours; to better hiding they went, and Bauldy stripp'd the coat and seemed to work the throngest. But no one appearing to alarm, they concluded that the person who raised it, must have been mistaken, so they returned to their houses, satisfied that this was the case.</p>

                <p>The Achan of the camp, however, slunk away from them, and returned next day with a party, seized the whole, to the utter astonishment of the smugglers in that quarter.</p>

                <p>Still, he took spirits to excess, was no very good husband, flashed away a small estate of land he fell heir to, lost his government place, got quite reduced, retired into the country, brought his scholarcraft into action, and taught a small rustic school. Bauldy though was too long in turning the dominie; his pupils were few, so he was obliged, though sore against his will, to mow and sow corn occasionally. After all, he was a fellow of great abilities; could I look through man with the same eyes that Bauldy used, I should think myself very clever indeed; he knew the lineage too, of all the families of note in Galloway; could follow them out like a squirrel along <pb n="53" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />every branch of the tree, and over and above, and double all that; he had good stories to tell for ever; good old tales, as many as would fill fifty numbers of any magazine now published; and then he told them, in a dialect of which he was a complete master, the Gallovidian; then he could sing well; that old song "The Shepherds of Galloway," he could give a twang to, that made it quite charming; he had numberless barrs and staves of song, but they in general had so many threads of blue interwoven in their frame, that I won't insult modesty by giving them. I may, however, note down a few verses of a very singular Poem he used frequently to recite, called "The Soldier's Prayer:"</p>

                <p>Frae a' lang marches on rainy days,</p>

                <p>And frae a' stappages out o' our pays,</p>

                <p>After singing, he used to fetch a deep sigh, as if former days had crossed him, as doubtless they often did; then he'd give his exclamation, which always was hech, aweel an hech, and follow it, perhaps, by</p>

                <p>Up and waur them a' Wullie,</p>

                <p>Up and waar them a,</p>

                <p>And ding them down tae snaw Wullie.</p>

                <p>In his disposition was a great deal of good nature and resignation; he had a contented face, and took his meat well to the last; he had got a circle of friends about him that he visited, and they fed him, but had the weather been bad, and he not able to get out to see them, he was then ill enough off, as he hoarded up nothing at home.</p>

                <p>The worthy family of Drumore were extremely kind to him, and let him want for nothing they could furnish him with; he was, perhaps, the best beggar that ever tried the trade, for he always got plenty of food and clothes without asking for them; and when a kimmering, a kirsening, a kirn or a wedding, took place within his reach, he was sure to smell it out, for the sake of catching drops of his favorite luxury, whisky; and about the new year time he was often carried home to his crue, on a handbarrow, just mortal. Tobacco he chew'd to excess, the brew of which ran in a brown rill from either wick o' his mou', as if it had been trikle; he knew well the persons who keep'd the best filled spleuchans in his part of the country, and also, wha was best gien o' a' chow; nor was he wanting of generosity; for when any well-wishers filled his spleuchan, he would present it again to them, to take a chew in return. The news of the country, or the kintra-clash, was well known to Bauldy, and he turned it to his advantage; all messages were bandied by him from house to house, parties were set, lads and lasses appointed to meet, all through Bauldy. In this respect he much resembled the celebrated Eddy Ochiltree. Children, where <pb n="55" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />ever he went, were very fond of him, and hung on by his clickett staff and coat tails. The servant wenches, though were often very much displeased with him, because of his questions, and his opinions of them, he was such an accomplished master of human nature, that he knew exactly what would please, and what not; these girls would rather have endured any thing, as a banter from Bauldy; his words pierced their very marrow, and made them shake at the centre.</p>

                <p>He got very soon acquainted with strangers, and with loungers like himself, he bore the bell-was quick at detecting lies-he knew falsehood, he said, by its very unnatural sough; he never cared much about the servants of any house; ay, the gude man and the gude wife were those he warmly inquired after-he had wisdom in this too—.</p>

                <p>Praising the bairns before the mither's face-this was too, one of his unfailing plans-saying that "sic a ane had just the bonny een of its mither, for he minded weel what they were like at fairs lang syne-that there was na sic a spangin clever hizzie on a' the kintra-side." Politics and newspapers he was always very fond of: still inquiring at those whom he thought skilled in these matters, how the war was coming on, and how that fell fallow, Bonny, was skelpin through?" then, if he was told "that there lately had been a great stramash, many towns sacked, many men killed, and so forth," with tobacco-sap, dropping brown from his chin, he'd exclaim, aweel an hech</p>

                <p>He died the other year, in the parish of Kelton, when he was above eighty years of age. The following epitaph on him, was one of my boyish crimes :</p>

This chief man attends him when he is about to <pb n="64" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />take the hand of the bride in the marriage ceremony. This man stands beside him, and ungloves the hand. This man, so highly favoured, attends him too at the "kirken"; and, on the whole, is often as happy looking as the bridegroom. Widows choose widows, and sometimes married men, for their "best men," never pitching on any of the unmarried.</p>

When a young girl gets any piece of new dress, she slyly shows it to her Joe, who gives her a kiss, which is taking the beverage of the article in question. And when he gets any thing, they kiss again, which is giving the beverage. The bridegroom takes the beverage of his bride by kissing her the instant the marriage ceremony is over; but if any other person be so nimble as to have a kiss before him, that person gets the beverage.</p>

                <p>BIG-ON. A term at the game of channelstone, much used by my worthy and social friend Drummore. If a stone lies near the cock, and guarded, yet thought to need <pb n="65" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />double guard, if not a triple. The order from that side who has in the stone, is commonly to big-on-to guard away-to "block the ice." And the command of the other party is mostly, when things are in this situation, to come up wi' a' the powther the horn and waken the guards. Old wary curlers, however, take a different plan. They won't waste stones on the guards. They sail them past the sentinels, nigh wutter length, obtains a Inring, plays on it, and not unfrequently drives out the winner, thought by t'other side to be even almost too secure.</p>

                <p>BILLY MARSHALL.-The famous Gallovidian gypsey, or tinkler. He was of the family of the Marshall's, who have been tinklers in the south of Scotland time out of mind. He was a short, thick-set, little fellow, with dark quick eyes; and, being a good boxer, also famous at the quarter staff, he soon became eminent in his core; and having done some wonderful trick by which he got clear off, he was advanced to be the chief of the most important tribe of vagabonds that ever marauded the country. The following was that trick:-He and his gang being in the neighbourhood of Glasgow when there was a great fair to be held in it, himself and two or three more of his stamp, having painted their faces with keel, they went to the fair and enlisted, getting each so much cash. They then deserted to their crew in the wild mountain glen, leaving the soldiers without a single cue whereby to find them. For all, Billy once really took the bounty, joined the army, and went to the wars in Flanders; but one day he accosted his commanding officer, who was a Galloway gentleman, this way: "Sir, ha'e ye ony word to send to <pb n="67" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />your friends in Scotland at présent ?” "What by that?" returned the officer, " is there any person going home?" "Ay," continued Billy," Keltonhill fair is just at hand. I ha'e never been absent frae it since my shanks could carry me to it, nor do I intend to let this year be the first." The officer, knowing his nature, knew it would be vain to try to keep him in the ranks, so bade him tell his father and friends how he was; he also gave him a note to take to his sweetheart. So Marshall departed, was at Keltonhill fair accordingly, and ever after that paid much respect to the family of Maculloch, of Ardwell.</p>

                <p>It is not my intention to give a lengthened portrait of this character, as one of the above family, who personally knew him, has done this for me, and much better than I could, in Blackwood's Magazine. Suffice it to say, that the Corse o' Slakes was a favourite haunt of his. There did he frequently way-lay the unwary, and sometimes deprived them of both life and purse. Billy's gang were seldom ever beat by any others. When they met at fairs, he generally drove all before him; for the Irish took up with him from Down and Derry, and who can overcome them at the handling of the stick? To those country Cock Lairds who were kind to him, he would do them no injury, but all the good in his power; whereas, those who were his foes-Billy was upside with them.</p>

                <p>He would not have cared to have taken up lodging-he and his core-in one of these gentlemen's kills-to have purloined the greater part of the poultry, and roasted them with the wood of the roof of said kill-to have there staid a week, perhaps, in spite of every body-gone away at his own time-and left a world of desolation behind him. It was in one of these scenes that he drank, May ne'er waur be amang us--a toast that can be construed in many shapes. Thus did he flounder on through a long <pb n="68" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />life. When he got old, his people, though in a great measure, forsook him.</p>

                <p>It seems that he had both the good and bad qualities of man about him in a very large degree. He was kind, yet he was a murderer-an honest soul, yet a thief-at times a generous savage-at other times a wild Pagan. He knew both civil and uncivilized life-the dark and fair side of human nature. In short, he understood much of the world-had no fear-a happy constitution-was seldom sick-could sleep on a moor as soundly as in a featherbed-took whisky to excess-died in Kirkcudbright at the age of 120 years-was buried there in state by the Hammer-men, which body would not permit the Earl of Selkirk to lay his head in the grave, merely because his Lordship was not one of their incorporated tribe. Such was the end of Billy Marshall, a brother of Meg Merriless.</p>

                <p>BLACK DOUGLASS.-Perhaps the greatest villain ever known in Galloway; his den was the castle of Thrave, a befitting keep for the tyger; he keep'd the country round him in awe for many a day; even the Scotch kings could make nothing of him. He caused Lord Kirkcubrie, M'Lellan, to be hanged by a rope from a projecting stone in his castle wall, yet to be seen, and took his dinner calmly while his hangmen were doing so. Some say he was "durked" in Annandale, but how he came by his death is uncertain; however he did not die a natural death. More or less particulars of the wretch may be known by peeping into any book almost which treats of Scottish antiquities.</p>

                <p>BLACK-LEG. A kind of murrain or plague amongst cattle. The disorder for common seizes first on one of the hind legs, and this leg, when the animal dies, (which is in less <pb n="73" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />than twenty-four hours mostly from the time struck) is of a black colour; whence the name. Sometimes they are touched first with the distemper in the eye, and other parts of the body. Young cattle are more subject to it than old; and it is always the best of the flock that die, though all perish that take it, there being no cure as yet found.</p>

                <p>Plans for preventing it are practised-bleeding, purging, what not; these plans are often attended with good. Too old pasture is thought to be nothing in favour of it, and all allow that it is highly infectious.</p>

                <p>BLACK MORROW.-Who this man was, baffles all antiquaries.</p>

                <p>Tradition has him a "Blackimore," and says he haunted the forests south of Kirkcudbright; a natural wood there, is yet called the "Black Morrow Wud"; there he stopped during the day, sallying out on the neighbouring country at night, and committing horrible outrages. Also, that having found his retreat, which was beside a cool spring, in the dark forest yet called the "Blackimore's Wall," a barrel of spirits was brought by the people, and poured into the spring well one night when he was out on his rambles. Next day, having drank of the fountain as usual, he became touched with the grog, and fell asleep, snoring profoundly; his foes then rushed on him, like the Philistines on Samson, and "dirked his heart wi mony a deedly hole."</p>

                <p>So goes tradition-but my opinion, if it be worth any thing, is, that he was no "Blackimore;" he never saw Africa; his name must have been "Murray;" and as he must have been too an outlaw, and a bloody man-gloomy with foul crimes-"Black" prefaced it, as it did Black Douglass, and that of others; so he became Black Murray. Antiquarians say the sum of 50l. was offered by the king for his head, dead or alive.</p>

                <p>That one of the McLellans, of Kirkcudbright, took to the wood single-handed, with a dirk, found the outlaw <pb n="74" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />sleeping, and drove it through his head. With the cash he bought the estate of Barmagauchen, in Borgue; the foundation of the "head on the dagger" in the M'Lellan's coat of arms.</p>

                <p>BLINCHAMP. A very singular rustic game; when a bird's nest is found, such as a Corbies or Hoodicraws, or some such birds that the people dislike, the nest is herried, that is to say, the eggs are taken out of it, and laid in a row a little from each other on the grass; one of the players has then something bound over the eyes to blind them, a stick is put in his hand, so he marches forth as he thinks right to the egg-row, and strikes at it; an other tries the champing after him until they thus, blindfolded, break them; hence the name blinchamp.</p>

In Scotland, more boggles are seen and heard of than there are in all the rest of the world; how this comes to pass may be difficult to define, but so it is. In every country of a similar form, composed chiefly of hill and dale, rocks and wild mountains, we find the natives having their boggles; the Welsh and Swiss are this way, and many others. But what have they in comparison to the Scots? what are their knockers and reckers, to warlocks without end, worricows, kelpies, spunkies, wraiths, witchies, and carlines? what, a mere nothing-accounts of these supernatural beings will appear in their proper order, and show that the Scots are a nation not only famous for religion, war, learning and independence; but also for superstition, which practically proves this point in moral philosophy, that fear attends the brave, as modesty does the worthy; and in proportion as the intellect is weak or strong.</p>

                <p>BONSPIEL-The highest game at curling-the chief spiel. When one parish, for instance, challenges another to play it, at the famous Scottish game of curling, or channlestane, that bout on the ice is called a bonspiel. The best players on these occasions are selected to play, and when not only their own honour, but that of their parish is at stake, they do, or at least strive to do, their very best; though often good players are put into such a flutter at these times that they lose the steadiness of their han', and play badly those who keep unmoved amid the crowd, and pay no attention to either damns or huzzas, play always best. The parishes of Borgue, Sorby, and Closeburn, <pb n="80" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />rank amongst the first of the curling communities in the south of Scotland.</p>

                <p>Sometimes cock-lairds challenge other to fight a bonspiel, and often these concerns turn out to be wars indeed. The following poem depicts a broolzie of this</p>

                <pb n="81" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

                <p>And 'ere they did the play begin,</p>

                <p>Ilk stamock gat a cauker,</p>

                <p>For, nane did think it was a sin</p>

                <p>Most bonnily to tak her.</p>

                <p>Ahin the quickly toomed glass,</p>

                <p>How the wee finger twirled,</p>

                <p>Than up in air a bawbee was,</p>

                <p>For heads or tails hie birled</p>

                <p>To lead that day.</p>

                <p>Laird Nurgle had that triffing luck,</p>

                <p>Sae his first player led;</p>

                <p>The stane to his direction stuck,</p>

                <p>But by the cock it fled;</p>

                <p>At which began to fidge the laird,</p>

                <p>And muttering to blame him;</p>

                <p>Laird Nabbles' man nae better fared,</p>

                <p>For Nabble loud did damn him,</p>

Two Galloway priests, once passing a fellow who was good at flinging every thing into rhyme quoth the one to the other, "I hold ye a sixpence, Clinking Charlie will be beat with what I say to him?"-Done, says the other: so, when they passed the poet, the priest held out his finger at him, sounding boo, when the man of clink instantly returned—</p>

                <p>BORGUE-One of the most singular and celebrated parishes in the south of Scotland, and one too of the very best that is to be found in any country. The following poem, by an old bard of the name of Hackston, belonging to the said <pb n="84" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />parish, I here give, altered somewhat of course to suit my own foolish taste, and, perhaps, partly wrote by mysell, as my muse is quite ready with her aid, when any thing occurs, poor jade, that she can help me to</p>

                <p>Can send his muse to India for a time,</p>

                <p>To wallow sweetly in that luscious clime</p>

                <p>'Mang ladies, harams, and delicious flowers,</p>

                <p>Melodious groves, and lovely vernal showers;</p>

                <p>BRAGWORT.-Mead. A fermented liquor, made from honey a wort that can brag all others for being so good. Hence the name bragwort. After the bees are smuiked in the hinharrest time, the gude wife takes the kaimes out of the skep, and lets the hinny drop out of them before the fire; when this is done, she takes these combs or kaimes and steeps them in water. This water, warmed and quickened with barm, composes bragwort. It is an extreme sweet and pleasant drink; when put in bottles it is apt to break them. That person is a particular favourite in that house, when, by making a call, he is treated with a draught of bragwort. If he be a young man of fair character, looking out for a wife, and this house be a place where fair dames are, he is sure to taste bragwort. It may be called with propriety the "lover's drink.”</p>

                <p>BRAXY.-A disorder prevalent amongst sheep, and in general a very fatal one. The animal soon dies after in<pb n="90" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />fected, and there is no cure for it as yet discovered that can be said to avert the evil. Sheep in good condition are those it makes great havoc of. That kind of weather with hoar frost after rain is the worst for it; shepherds then are sure to have much mortality amongst their flocks. Braxy is a malady attended always with an abominable stench. Strangers unused to it cannot for some time suffer it at all. Their smelling organs will not endure it; and. much longer are they in bringing themselves to be able to eat the flesh of the poor animals who perish, let it be boiled, stewed, roasted, or any way dressed. All the spice in the world will not keep down the noxious smell. The braxy effluvia keeps still uppermost: the daught predominates. In truth, it is not a very wholesome food. Those feeding much on it become blotched, and not unfrequently are troubled with that filthy disease, the yaws.</p>

                <p>BRAXY-HAMS.-The hams of those sheep which die of the braxy. When the herd finds any of his flock dead of that distemper, if they can stand three shakes-that is to say, if they be not so putrified or rotten but that they can stand to be thrice shaken by the neck without falling to pieces-then he bears them home to his master's house on the braxy shelty. What of the carcases can then be ham'd, are done, and the rest of the flesh made present use of by the family. The hams thus cut out are hung up in the smuiky brace, until they are quite dry. They are then bound in bunches, like so many hare-skins, and suspended on nags and clicks, in convenient parts of the roof of the kitchen, and used now and then for very singular purposes. As for instance, when a club of burn trout fishermen, or one of muirfuel sportsmen, come the way of the house, they are hospitably entertained at table with plenty of braxy ham, and other dainties; for the natives of the moors are a kind people, and generally keep what is understood by a fu' house. Now I am not <pb n="91" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />sneering at present; but honestly saying, that a male o' sic food, washed down by a few glasses of peatreek, or tumblers of bragwort, please a hungry kyte very much, and cause one to fall in love with mountaineers. For braxy is by no means bad food, when ham'd; the smell then in a great measure leaves it. Likewise these hams sometimes adorn the saddle-bow of a moorland lover, when he starts a horseback to seek a wife, and are considered to aid him much in making his putt-gude with any girl he takes a fancy for, particularly if she be a laich fiel lass; though he is often disappointed in this speculation. However, on the whole, there is worse furniture to be found in a house, in cold, snowy, wintry weather, than plenty of braxy ham.</p>

                <p>BREW.-Opinion. This word deserves further consideration “I ha'e nae great brew o' that man," is often said, and means," I have no great opinion of that man." Also, "I "I ha'e a good brew," which signifies the reverse. Now, this "brew cannot be allied to "broe," sap or fluid of some kind, but may be to "brow," the front of the brain, as those who read phizzes place much dependance on what they find on the brow; still this comes not to the point. I am flung back to "brew,”—and this may mean, to make, to conceive; as ale is brewed; for we are said to be brewing" when we are thinking. So the word, for all, may come from this: "I ha'e nae great brew."--There is no brewing in the brain of any consequence.

The brugh or ruff, round the silvery orb, is very beautiful-so white and snowy just before the diskthen shading away, till the cicrumference of the fold is drawn by the intruding darkness,-whiles it is called the faul about the moon, or fold. The signification of brough is a gathering of foul matter, a collection of rubbish; so when it is seen, those skilled in the weather prophecy that there is going to be some onfa', or other-either of rain or something worse.</p>

                <p>BUCHANITES.-A singular sect of religious fanatics that first made their appearance in the neighbourhood of Glasgow about fifty or sixty years ago. From thence they came to Buchan ha', in the parish of Closeburn; and now the remnant of the core remain at a place in Galloway, called the Crooked-ford, a place about eight or nine miles westvfrom Dumfries. Their founder was a Mrs. Buchan, thevwife of a dyer in Glasgow. She was a very tall, strongvwoman; or, in the Scottish, a strapping hizzie. Hervhusband and her having had some dispute, she flung aside her litt pots, and left off the colouring of matter for the colouring of mind, and was so fortunate as soon to have many followers, all dipped in one dye. Amongst these was a fellow of the name of White, a colleged priest, as he was termed, a fellow who had been bred up for the church in some university, but having a weak brain, uufit <pb n="98" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />to hold the learning that was poured into it, he so became a fit subject for waiting upon Mrs. Buchan, and frantic as she could possibly be. White, however, aided her cause very considerably. He was quite an Abbo Bekar to Mahomet. When the innocent country people heard that a real priest, a minister of the word, had become a Buchanite, they gathered in from all quarters, and became so likewise.</p>

                <p>One of her chief tenets was, that all who followed her and her doctrine would go to heaven without tasting of death, like Elias, and that too, on a certain day which she prophesied for she always wished to be looked on as a prophetess, and that she alighted on earth at the Clauchan o' Thornhill, from heaven, keeping still the litt cats in the gorbals of Glasgow out of sight. At long and length the glorious day arrived on which they were all to be taken to the regions above, where endless happiness existed, and pleasure for evermore. Platforms were erected for them to wait on, until the wonderful hour arrived, and Mrs. Buchan's platform was exalted above all the others. The hair of ilka head was cut short-all but a tuft on the top, for the angels to catch by when drawing them up. The momentous hour came. Every station for ascension was instantly occupied. Thus they stood, expecting to be wafted every moment into the land of bliss, when a gust of wind came;-but, instead of wafting them upwards, it capsized Mrs. Buchan, platform and all! and the fall made her all hech again on the cauld yird. After this unexpected downcome, she fell into disgrace by her leaders, and her words had not so much weight with them; still, however, a great number clung by her; and one night (she having been ailing for some time before) a fit came on her, out of which she never recovered; but her disciples, thinking it to be a trance into which she had fallen, expected her to awake; but no signs of this appearing for some days, and her body beginning to have a putrid <pb n="99" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />smell, they thought it prudent to bury it in the earth beside the house; and by her have been laid all those of her sect who have since died.-So ends the tale of Lucky Buchan. She would allow none of her followers to marry, or have any love-dealings with other; so the tribe soon weeded away and became thin. It is said that there were many bastard bairnies appeared amongst them; but that they hardly ever let them behold the light. Be this as it may, their general character all along has been quite harmless. They were, and yet are, a very industrious people, and have been long unmatched at making Wee Wheels and Chackreels, plying the turning-loom to great perfection. They are all, however, of rather a wild frantic nature, and seem to want some pence of the shilling, a penny or more." After all, they have been an odd concern; and to think they arose in Scotland, a place</p>

                <p>is a thing to be wondered at. Many pamphlets and songs have been wrote respecting this species of Mahometans; but none of them that I have seen seem to have any touches of talent worthy of remark.</p>

                <p>BUMBEES. The wild humble bees. There are three kinds of these bees common in Scotland-the black, the brawnet, and the brown. The first has its nest deep in the ground, and they are generally found in very large colonies together; the second build and breed under ground too, but not so deep as the others; and the third, or brown, always on the surface. The sting of a wild bee is not so venomous as that of a tame one, neither are the bumbees so fierce as the others; but will fly buzzing round and round, and seldom dart in to sting-their bykes are robbed for common, without much trouble. The honey of bumbees is also quite weak and watry to that of the others; nor do they display great handy work in the formation of their combs; theirs are no hexagonal tubes, but dirty globular figures; they are no craftsmen in truth, nor yet near so nimble as the others in comparison; yet who does not love to hear them in the spring bumming amongst the sillarsaughs wi downie buds, or the opening leaves of the plaintree. In an old riddle the three kinds are thus specified</p>

                <p>BURIAL HOUSE. The house of mourning; the house wherein lies a corpse awaiting interment; it is termed the burial house but for one day, the day of the burial. BURLY WHUSH.-A game played at with a ball. The ball is thrown up by one of the players on a house or wall, who cries on the instant it is thrown to another to catch or kep it before it falls to the ground; they all run off but this one to a little distance, and if he fails in kepping it, he bawls out burly whush; then the party be arrested in their flight, and must run away no farther. He singles out one of them then, and throws the ball at him, which often is directed so fair as to strike; then this one at which the ball has been thrown is he who gives burly whush with the ball to any he chooses. If the corner of a house be at hand, as is mostly the case, and any of the players escape behind it, they must still shew one of their hands past its edge to the burly whush man, who sometimes hits it such a whack with the ball, as leaves it dirling for an hour afterwards.</p>

                <p>BURNBECKER.-The bird known also by the name of waterpyet, having a white breast, while the rest of its plumage is black, and a frequenter of burns or streams of water; it keeps its body in continual motion-beck-becking-hence the name burnbecker. It is one of the poet's favourite birds, not for its singing, for it sings none, nor for its beauty, having also little of that; but because it haunts places of deep solitude-lonely burns-where also do the bards of nature.</p>

                <p>BURNT-STANES.-A curling term. When a stone in motion hits another in passing slightly, it is said to burn on it; sometimes when they burn or rub rather roughly, they are said to have got their burthen; that is to say, they have got as much of their motion retarded by one stone, as hinders them to damage any more; and when a stone in motion hits the feet, or the broom of any player, not on the same side of the game with that stone, it is allowed to be played over again; but if it hit one on its own side, it is thrown off the ice; for why it is a burnt-stane. BURRBLE. Any thing in confusion. When a pirn of yarn in winding runs into disorder, it is then in a snurl or a burrble.</p>

It seems to be a bird of emigration; and, by its visiting us in winter, bespeaks it comes from some arctic nation. Indeed, Greenland is seen in all its moves; it is savage and coldhearted. No burd o' prey gives a clocken hen a greater glocken than the buttermilk gled.</p>

There are always two chief female servants about houses of this kind, called the " "byrewoman," and the "kitchinwoman," the cold half of the year; and the "outane" and the "innane" the other half; for in summer cows are put out of the byre.

                <p>He first threw his broad sword over the yawning chasmdid the mighty Scot's patriot; then followed it by making a tremendous leap himself. His fell, comrade Carlie durst not try that trick, but went down the precipice, and clam up to the assistance of his friend-what brave fellows→ was a place ever taken by storm in such a manner-there did they lay on like devils. Wallace took his great sword, <pb n="107" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />which was like the rafter of a house, both hands to the handle, and mowed the southeron loons down before him; some of whom, rather than receive a fleg from his metal keen, leaped over the heugh, where they were dashed to pieces below.</p>

In ancient burial grounds they are met with too; our ancestors, like the natives yet of every uncivilized country, huddled a number of stones on the graves of their dead.</p>

                <p>"I'll throw a stane to your Cairn," was a phrase used in the days of yore, and expressive of a kindness that would be shewn persons even when dead by throwing a stone now and then to the cairns on their graves.

An Irish bard, who had been stopping sometime in his neighbourhood, and who knew his character well, would make a song on him-the which I here give; because it contains some genius, and is wrote not only to a Galloway air, but in the Galloway language; some of the ideas however bespeak green Erin. It gave me some furbishing ado before I got its grammar, measure, and clink, in a fair looking passable way; but <pb n="109" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />indeed the confessions of an old blackguard will never look well</p>

When the bloody Grier o' Lagg and the Douglass's hunted the Covenanters over hill and dale, a poor man of the name of Dixon took up his abode in Carlines Co', and lived the whole of the time that foul persecution lasted, on the shell-fish he gathered on the seashore beside him, the which he found means to broil on a fire by night: thus he eluded the foes of his clan, the foes of God and man. The mouth of the cave is quite covered with brush-wood; at the farther end, or benmost bore of it, remains yet his seat- -a square sea-stone; on it I expected to find an inscription of some kind or other, but was deceived.

                <p>CARLINWARK LOCH-The most beautiful sheet of water in the south of Scotland; and if we except Loch Lomond, Loch Katerine, and some others of the lovely highland lakes, we have nothing to match the Carlinwark in Scotia; and even these highland lochs are rendered more beautiful than they are, by the pen of Sir Walter Scott. This lovely place lies about eighteen miles west from Dumfries, beside the thriving little village of Castle Douglass.</p>

                <p>When beheld on a summer's evening, when the weather is fine, when the sweet gay lasses are out strolling on its banks, and the pupils of Isaac Walton out in boats angling; when the trees on the woody islands are green, and the blackbird whistling amongst them, why the thing becomes Killarney at once, and not much behind Winander, the haunt of the lake poets. It is wonderful indeed, that a laker or two does not arise about the Carlinwark. I have heard of Gerrond and Kelvie, but what are these; they have both a little of the poet about them, but noting of the Wordsworth and Wilson school. Show Gerrond a flock of fat wild-ducks within the range of his swivel, on the lake, and you show him a scene he much more admires than quivering sun-beams, hues of azure, and other fine things. As for Kelvie, he might give us the poem of the Carlinwark Loch.</p>

                <p>"Ne'er a star peeps through the carry;" hear to the soft language of poor Tannahill, a bard or songster of the first kind, who drowned himself in the Clyde, when between forty and fifty years of age, in a fit of melancholy despair, Scotland, for all the warning she got with the early fate of Burns, and for all the stigmas deservedly piled on her, for his account, also shut her eyes on poor Tannahill, never changing him from the low situation of a Paisley weaver-no wonder that his tender heart could not withstand this treatment. I here give three verses to his memory, which I consider tolerable</p>

                <p>Ha, melancholy mirky wight,</p>

                <p>Grim Heckler o' the feeling soul,</p>

                <p>For a' the charms o' tenderness,</p>

                <p>His harmless bosom warmly felt,</p>

                <p>And thae his muse did sweet express,</p>

                <p>His melting heart made ithers melt.</p>

                <p>His bonny Jessie o' Dumblain,</p>

                <p>E'en Sleeping Maggie maks us fain',</p>

                <p>CASTLE O' RAEBERRY-One of the castles of the family of M'Lellan, in Galloway. It stood on a promontory on the shore of the Solway Frith, in the parish of Kirkcudbright; steep precipices flanked it all round, except the neck towards the main land, and cross this has been a deep trench, with a draw-bridge over it. The word "Berry," comes from the German berg, a lofty hill or mountain, and quite beside it is one of these large hills; for all such a place of strength as this castle was, it was not strong enough to keep out Black Douglass of Thrave; the tradition respecting his capture of it, is here told in an old song. It seems they had used boats about it, as an antiquary lately discovered a boatway, cut through the rocks beneath, on the shore.</p>

            <entry>
                <p>CASTLE O' THRAVE-The strongest castle in Galloway, and the most famous. It is a large square building, with hornworks, on an island in the river Dee. Francis Grose, the celebrated antiquary, gives a good account of it in his Antiquities of Scotland. It was anciently an infernal place, and many were the foul deeds there done; even at this day one shudders to inspect it: its thick walls, narrow windows and staircases, its rooms arch-roofed, and the dungeon yet remaining in perfection, make the blood freeze. I have seen no old castle (and I have seen now a good many), which conjured up scenes of ancient barbarism, and murder, more than this one; it seems as if it had been built for the sole purpose of conducting savage deeds. It was the seat of the Black Douglass, one of the most horrible devils that ever appeared in Scotland; he made his very king tremble for him, and hanged M'Clellan, Lord Kirkcubrie, against his order.</p>

                <p>The following verses of poetry I may here give, as respecting this fellow, and his Castle o' Thrace, or Trief, as in the ancient records of the house of Kenmore it stands; probably it is connected with reive—to rob, being quite a den of robbers and murderers :</p>

                <p>On a bonny green isle in the water o' Dee,</p>

                <p>As it rows frae the ken to the Soloway sea,</p>

                <p>Stands the tower of the baron, the fell bluidy knave,</p>

                <p>And the name o' his keep is the Castle o' Thrave.</p>

                <p>He has strung Lord Kirkcubrie owre his castle wa',</p>

                <p>The worthy M'Clellan o' wild Gallowa;</p>

                <p>The dumb sough o' vengeance we hear frae his grave,</p>

                <p>And it shall be answered at Castle o' Thrave.</p>

                <p>Mons Meg we'll drag out, and we'll thunner him down,</p>

                <p>We'll skelp him to hell, where his frien's will him crown,</p>

                <p>We'll show him what's honour, and how we'll behave,</p>

                <p>By dashing destruction on Castle o' Thrave.</p>

                <p>Let him rally his rebels through a' Gallowa,</p>

                <p>We care for them not, we shall conquer for a';</p>

                <p>We'll rush on our facs like the far-fetched wave,</p>

                <p>And sweep to damnation the Castle o' Thrave.</p>

                <p>CASTIN O' BEES-Bees are said to be "castin," when they are swarming. Sometimes, when the insects are in this state, they fly far away from their parents before they hive or alight, in spite of all the pistols that are fired, and water that may be thrown amongst them by their watchers, which is the cause of many a warm race to the rustics. The poem of the " Bee Hive" illustrates a haunt of this kind. See the article Broolzies.</p>

                <p>CASTIN UP-The art of making little arithmetical calculations. A mower once regretted to me that he had not learnt algebra at school, for then he could have "cast up jobs" on the nail o' his thum. Also, "castin up" is a mean way of reproaching persons, by reminding them of some little guilty slip in" youth," or of some crime of their ancestors. Such conduct frequently leads to serious broils. A man on horseback came up with another rider like himself, while going to a Dumfries Rude fair once, and quoth the one who overtook, "Whar come ye frae, gude man, gin ane might spear:" e'en out o' the parish o' Cowen,' replied he; "I was thinking sae (returned the first), for, like a' your parish fowk, ye sit far back on the hinder part o' the beast." "Ablins, (quoth his companion) and whar come ye frae, is a fair quastion for you now to auswer." "O, am Mr. K—, of R——," he replied, "I just thought sae (quoth the Cowend man), for I see the stedd o' the gallows that hanged Henry Gregg, on your back." On casting up which they at each other with loaded whups, and the forward Mr. K. was left sprawling on the road.</p>

                <p>CAUMSHELL, or CLAMSHELL, or MAYSHELL-A beautiful white piece of shelly or boney matter, in shape somewhat like a lady's slipper, frequently found driven in upon our shores. It is reduced by nowt doctors to a fine powder, and blown through the hollows of quills into cattles' eyes which have motes in them, such as flichters o' caff, when the sharp dust instantly causes the animal's optic orb to be flooded with water, so that it winks much, and by so doing, cuts the scum and obstruction away. What these bones or shells are, like many things else, I have not discovered, nor do I know that any have: some say that they are formed on the breasts of certain sea-fowl, which moult them now and then; others, that they are the bones of a fish called the clamfish; and others again, that they are of a coral nature. I would wish to know what some great naturalist says respecting them. Linnæus, the famed Swede, will have them to be the scallop shell (ostrea opercularis), and to this clings Dr. Jamieson, the great Scottish lexicographer, a person whom no Scotsman can praise too much, who has given the world a dictionary unmatched for the learning and antiquarianism contained in it; and considering that nothing of the kind but some few glossaKries had been done before, the work truely becomes a wonderful compend; yet, as to the term under consideration methinks, with all due deference to the Doctor, that it is not of kin to the old French word clame, a pilgrim's mantle, but to the Galloway scaum—scum, because its use is in taking the scum off eyes. Now, in Scotland there has been a fashion of prefacing various words with S as swhirrls, sturnills, &amp;c.; now if this letter be taken off scaum, we have caum, which is the popular name by which the shell is known.</p>

                <p>CHANNLE-STANE-Curling, the game at the ice; also the stone a player plays with in the game. Some think the name comes from channle, the bed of a river, because round stones were got in such places anciently, which pleased our forefathers well enough to play with, before we found out the way of making them artificially. Others again think, as these stones have to be kept running in one <pb n="131" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />channle as it were upon the ice, that they have had their name from this. It is hard to say which is right; so, I shall content myself by saying, that there is not a more manly or a better game played on the earth than the chaunlestane.</p>

                <p>CHAPMEN-Pedlers, hawkers, &amp;c. Scotland, famous fo many things, is also famous for her pedlers. Anciently, the Scottish pedlers in Poland were a respectable body; now they keep nearer home, and travel about in England, and in general, are a class very highly thought of; neither Englishmen nor Irishmen make such pedlers as they: indeed, the English try it a little, but not so the Irish, and an Irish pedler is always as mean a looking object as is to be met with; the wares he hawks are of the lowest kind, in truth, he knows not the proper way to shoulder a bundle. Scotsmen are naturally fond of this business; for why, they detest slavery. A young Scotsman of spirit, before he will be bowed down with his nose in the earth, and become a labourer to his superiors, will be a pedler. He is then soon his own master, and the business being of a wandering nature, leads him to see curiosities, a thing the sons of the north are fond of; and, after acquiring some money at the trade, he leaves it for something of a more honourable name. Thus then, it is no discredit to Scotsmen, the pedling trade. I know not of any other which can match it, as a stepping stone for young men of common talents, that they may leap on to from a humble situation, and from thence to something better.</p>

                <p>CHAPMEN'S DROWTH-People are said to have this drowth, drought, or thirst about them, when they are not only in need of some fluid to slake it, but food to take with it. It is called the chapmen's drowth, because pedlers of a low class, in calling at country houses to vend their wares, complain often to gude wives that they are drowthy, which means, if they have any food to spare in the pantry, they will not cast out with a cull, or piece of it.</p>

                <p>CHAUMER-A chamber, from old French chaumere, a little hut. This chaumer, or chammer, was a kind of detached room of the farm-houses of yore: here slept all the young men belonging to the family. The chaumer, as it were, was their apartment, the place they could call their own; in it were their beds and kists, what not. This was the place of all merriment; thither came cronnies to see cronnies; here were lasses brought by their Joes and courted; here the country clash sounded; here were songs <pb n="133" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />sung, tales told, dams played; here the gude man or gude wife seldom made their appearance, unless they were given to mirth; and many old men of cheerful natures preferred sitting in the chaumer ateen, to any other place about the house. To close though, I do not know that we have so much fun and hilarity now as our forebears had in the chaumers o' auld lang syne.</p>

A young fellow, who had been out of the country a little while, pretended, when he came back, to know nothing of the mother country: even this tool, which was reclining against a wall, its name seemed to have fled his memory. "Come, what devil do ye call this," said he to his rustic friends, laying his foot rashly on the mouth of it, when the shaft sprang up, and hit him in the face. "O! d-n the claut," he exclaimed, not waiting for an answer from his humble companions; the name striking him by a strange association.</p>

They tied them to stakes on the sand, and left them to perish with the coming tide. When asked how the poor wretches behaved, when the sea was coming foaming about them, they said, "that they clepped round the stobbs like partons, and prayed," viz. wreathed round the stakes; after which saying, they were always called "Cleppie Bells," and the fingers of their hands grew strangely together, which deformity yet attends their race.</p>

The clue was produced, she took one end of it and flang it into the air, and after muttering a few words, vanished in a moment. To win the blue clue in the killpot on halloween, was a serious matter before Burns made the world laugh at it.</p>

Tradition says, that no human eyes ever beheld the back side, or farthest extremity of this cave; that a dog once went in at its mouth and came out at the door o'Cairnsmoor, a place nearly ten miles from it; and when the tyke did come out he was found to be all sung (singed), as if he had passed through some fire ordeal or other.</p>

                <p>COWANS.-Those who would wish to know the mysteries of free masonry, without being regularly initiated, a thing both mean and foolish to attempt; mean, because they are cowards, and dare not go boldly forward like men; foolish, for unless they do so, masonry they never, never can know, no not the slightest thing about it; they may rail against the ancient and glorious institution, because they are held in ignorance, a thing which harms it nothing, for masonry, while time remains, will always find patrons in warm-hearted, social, and independent men. All other arts but it, of man's formation, sometime or other decays, and are reeled rotten into the bastile of oblivion, it alone remains the oracle of ages, and stands on a foundation so deeply grounded in nature, that no storm, though ever so rude, can make it in the smallest totter.</p>

                <p>CRAIG O'HERONS.-The herons having the long craig or neck; these birds get extremely lean in body about the dark o' the moon, or when the moon is about the change, because they see not then to fish, and are birds that feed mostly by night; and being of a gluttonous nature, it is not a wee thing that serves them; indeed, the heron is a bird that may be well said to eat itself out of ply, for it is always very lean; a stranger to this bird, on seeing it fly, would think it very weighty, by the trouble it seems to sustain itself in the atmosphere, but this is the reverse; it is on account of its bulk and lightness, the wind can drive it almost where it will, it is a very timid bird; come upou him unawares, while wading about in a lonely pool, he has not the fortitude to get under way, and may be caught. This is the bird that vomits the shot star, that clear gluey matter found in fishy marshes; instead of being a production of the lofty regions of aether, as long fancied; it is now found to proceed from the greedy gizzerons of lang-necked, or craig o'herons.</p>

                <p>CRIFFLE. A large hill in the south-east corner of Galloway. I have seen many funny conjectures made about the derivation of its name, as of the devil; and also the famous. wizzard Michael Scott, having it once in a creel" fixed round their bodies with a rope, that the rope there broke, and the "creel fell," so from that taking the name; however, I cannot see the use of giving the fancy such a flight, in order to come at the thing wanted. Does "criff" in <pb n="146" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA146#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />no ancient norlan tongue signify "cliff?" I think it does, or else it is a corruption of "cliff," and as for the other half, it surely comes from " fell," a wild rocky range; so putting the two together we have "Cliffell," which is as near the name "Criffle" as the other "Creel-fell," and surely nearer the representation of it, for it is a place entirely composed of cliffs and fells.</p>

Inventive fancies have suggested the firing of cannon balls at them through the nocturnal gloom; then fiuding in day-light the places struck by the bullets, which would be in the neighbourhood of the rare minerals; but I know not whether this plan has ever been yet tried.</p>

                <p>CROMEK.-An English gentleman of the name of Robert Cromek, whose memory every Scotsman ought highly to respect. He was born in Yorkshire, had a genius for engraving, but a greater for a particular species of litera<pb n="147" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />ture the songs and manners of the days of yore; the works of Burns first gave him a bent this way, nor could he rest being so charmed with the muse of our great bard, until he took a trip to Scotland, and gathered the "reliques of Burns," a very amusing work, for which he was made a member of the Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh. Having published this book in London, he again set sail for the land of song, with his legendary wallet, and having arrived in the fertile, regions of the south of Scotland, he soon was enabled to fill his budget by the aid of a bard he there forgathered with, and Mrs. Coupland, a lady at Dalbeatty, Galloway. This lady's exquisite taste in poetry furnished him with some delightful matters. O! would she but publish the effusions of her own muse, what a treat would this be to auld Scotland. The bard our enthusiastic Englishman fell in with, was no less a one than Mr. Cunningham; he met with the poet amid his rural haunts, singing of all the sweets of nature; and as I have heard, Mr. C. presented him with some of his poetical pieces, in order to have his opinion respecting their merits, the which Mr. Cromek ratherly sneered at, which caused the bard, when he shewed him any more of his productions, to say they were of the olden time, the which bait he greedily swallowed; whether he ever was aware of the songs being all mostly Cunningham's is not for me to say; he has lauded them as being extremely good, and as belonging to that part of the world; in doing so, he has said but the truth; now, why should there be such a jangling abroad in the world about this and similar things? if a poem be met with decidedly good, matters it much whether it was written in this or that century; the works of Ossian, the Song of Hardyknute, Chatterton's Poems, and the Nithsdale and Galloway song, I admire as much for my own part as if they had been all known as well about dates, places, every thing, as the poems of Burns.</p>

                <pb n="148" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

                <p>Mr. Cromek had certainly a very just idea of what composed a good song; his taste in this respect seems to have been great, and considering the land he passed his youth in, it is wonderful to conceive how well he was acquainted with the manners of the Scots, the nature of their songs, and expressions of their language; worthy man, he died of a consumption in London sometime in March, 1812, when but a young man, leaving a widow and two children. Mr. Cunningham has given a sketch of his character, which is to be found in the front sheets of a spacious edition of a poem called the "Grave," by Blair, published by Ackerman, bookseller, Strand. He never wrote very much himself, but was very active, gathering rarities and getting them pressed. On the whole he was a man in every sense of the word, whose memory deserves not to be neglected.</p>

                <p>A SONG BY BENJIE KELLAUCHEN.</p>

                <p>O! my love she is fair,</p>

                <p>And modest and neat,</p>

                <p>O! charming's her air,</p>

                <p>Let her dress how she will,</p>

                <p>Enchanting she's still,</p>

                <p>O! she makes me to gaze, and she makes my heart thrill.</p>

                <p>Full many a maid,</p>

                <p>I have loved to kiss,</p>

                <p>But my lips ne'er were laid</p>

                <p>On a sweet mouth like this;</p>

                <p>When the hills hide the sun,</p>

                <p>When the evening's begun,</p>

                <p>Then, then, to my darling I swiftly do run.</p>

                <p>And she waiteth for me</p>

                <p>By the banks of burn,</p>

                <p>'Neath the brown hazle tree,</p>

                <p>The fairies dance round,</p>

                <p>On the flower covered ground,</p>

                <p>O! that is the place where true pleasure is found.</p>

                <p>To her I do give</p>

                <p>My hand and heart free;</p>

                <p>O! would she but live</p>

                <p>In contentment with me,</p>

                <p>I would shield her from harms,</p>

                <p>With the power of my arms,</p>

                <p>CURRBAWTY. The art of seeking quarrel; some people, to their misfortune, are good at this, for they too often find it, and are frequently sadly forfoughten; there are <pb n="155" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />some again who can steer their way through this life, bad as it is, and never have a battle with any body. I once heard a cheel say, "that a worry refreshed him-that it claw'd his back, and that he could not live if now and then he had not a brattle with his fellows;" for my own part "I relish quietness at a price too much," as Pomfret, says; and should any write against this queerish book and myself, with the high swinging language of damnation, mine eldritch jaw should never be opened in self defence; the broosle they should have without fighting for it. hate the mean art of Currbawty as I hate the devil; what is the use of making this world worse than it is?

                <p>CUTTIE-MUN-A short person, with an extremely small face. This face is said to be like a mun. Dr. Jamieson has munn to be a short-hafted spoon, and adds, it is a Galloway word. In this I differ from him; cutty-horn or cutty-spoon, is the name I have heard, mun always applied to a little face. I have sometimes thought this mun, this word of perplexity was derived from moon, cuttie-moon, a little moon of a face: but this will not do well either, for <pb n="156" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />we have a phrase, when speaking of a man with a large face, that he has a face as brade as a moon. I am sorry to leave the word baffled. The doctor thinks that it may come from the islandie, munn, the mouth; now it is not the mouth that is the thing which makes us say a face is like a mun, it is the little circumference of that face. Old people, on the grave's brink, are said to have faces shrunk into that form.</p>

                <p>CUTTY-WRAN-The wren, the little nimble bird: how quick it will peep out of the hole of an old foggy dyke, . and catch a passing butterfly. Manx herring-fishers dare not go to sea without one of these birds, taken dead with them, for fear of disasters and storms. Their tradition is of a "sea-sprit," that haunted the "herring-tack," attended always by storms, and at last it assumed the figure of a wren and flew away. So they think when they have a dead wren with them, all is snug. The poor bird has a sad life of it in that singular island; when one is seen at any time, scores of Manxmen start and hunt it down.</p>

            <p>DAMDYKE-A mound of earth flung across a stream, to confine the water, for mechanical affairs. Spates" often drive these dykes before them, to the grief of millers and others; a very worthy and singular miller, of my acquaintance, once told me the following:-" I had been in at the market, and ablins, I might hae taen a gill or twa mair than was right, nought mair likely. I had been in 'Dinnies' by the Brig, too, and minds o' me, haeing a twelie wi' Lucky. But let thae flees stick i'the wa'. After I had lifted Gillronnie brae, I foun' mysell soberin, sat down on a taff-dyke, and took a look o' the lift. The moon was wadin deep, and there was a damnable sough i'the sea owre the Ross. I saw a spate brewin plainly, every clud the carry brought whiskin by, tell'd me. I thought o my damdyke. The brod maun be lifted wi' the screw the night ony way, or it will be a' to the pot or morning. This said I to mysell, started, catched clicky again, pat a chew <pb n="159" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />o' Jeannie's best i'my mouth, and held straught on to the dam.</p>

            <p>"But whan I cam in sight o' the Milton, frien' Johnnie's wather-glass cam i'my head. I had heard o' certain gentlemen farmers consulting the mercury,' sae I, for ance, wad consult it too. Gaed in tae house-Johnnie was na gane lie, I foun' him taking a blaw o' the pipe owre the fire, wi' the mowdieman. Quo' I, how's the glass the night, man?' we're gaen to hae a wather brack, that's my notion o't, sae I maun down tae dam, and lift the brod, or I'll hae nae dam i'the morning."</p>

            <p>"Howt's fool," quo' Johnnie, "we're gaen to hae nae spate. Auld Guthrie has filled ye wi' thae babbles as ye cam' by now, the glass is up, awa atween fair and dry; but we'll tak the cannle, and look, gin ye like, there's nae fear o' your dam the night ony way." We did sae, the thing was as he had said, the mercury was up, awa by "fair and dry." But gang out man, and look at the lift, and hear the sough i'the sea; gif they look na like a spate, they cheat me, quo' I. "Howt's fool," quo' he, " its your ain lugs that sough the night, and wha kens but your e'en may be a wee thing glazed too. We'se hae a glass o' whusky owre this ony way." To this I was "nothing loath," as the great Milton says, for by this time, wi' sweating, drinking water, and chewin tobacco, my mouth was got dry, and a "wrack" had gathered brown roun' my lips, like the wrack on the shore roun' the sea. Ae glass brought anither; him and me tae jawner, and whan I gat hame, lord knows. I wakened i' the morning wi' an awfu sair head; the ducks I heard giein queer eldrich squakes about the "lade." I pat on my mill-claise, and gaed out: the wun was awfu'; the rain was fa'in in stoupfu's. I set af to unscrue the dam wi' a haste; but or I wan haufway till't, there its coming meeting me, rowin just afore a sea o' water. I had eneuch ado to wun out o' its range. The hale was fearfu' to look at; on it roared and famed, covered <pb n="160" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />my bit meadow with sods, nor did it rest till it rolled into Mollock Bay, making the sea, as far as the Netherlaw Head, muddy. What cud I do; to fret needless, but wha cud keep frae't. "Let it lie there," quo' I, "there's nae faith to be pitten in whusky and wather-glasses."</p>

"Parties, in the country," viz. meetings among friends, are never fixed to be held during this season, and several wild animals which roam during the night for prey, get lean in flesh at this absence of the radiance of the nocturnal queen. The fox and owl miss her light very much, but none more so than that bird we call the craig o' heron; it is then nothing but a rickle o' banes, covered with feathers, and has given rise to the saying, when any one is down in flesh, like an Edinburgh Student, that he resembles the craig o'heron at the "dark o' the moon."</p>

He is fat, and "hotters" about the clauchans with boys after him, always smiling. He has as much sense as to take food and coppers when they are offered him; and, like a true idiot, will not work for any body. He seems to have some ear for music, as all fools <pb n="162" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />have, and might probably, who knows, have been learned to write rhyme.

                <p>DEACON MA'MINN-The Borgue philosopher. This was quite a Dr. Franklin, if he had had his industry; but, wanting that (except for me), he would have sunk into oblivion. The Deacon was a rustic of no common intellect it is pleasant to reflect on his vast mind, even though it was rude. Had he received the benefit derived from education, there is no saying how far he might have explored the ocean of science; what unknown lands he might have found; and what gems, by diving, he might have brought up to light. For the greater part of his life (and it was not a short one), he lived in a little hut beside the Glebe of Senwick, and wrought just at labouring work, hoeing whins, quarrying stones, &amp;c. He seldom was a bound labourer, he was ratherly what is called a jobber, taking little spells of work from those who had them to give, and doing them at his leisure, for the Deacon would never allow himself to be a hard worker, his great mind insisted frequently for time to reflect on the various works of nature which presented themselves before him. He was fond of Botany, and had a little garden filled with flowers, fruit-trees, and bee-hives. All the Gardeners in Galloway knew the Deacon, and would have come twenty miles and upwards, for the one purpose of having a crack with him. With them he exchanged visits and plants, and was a welcome guest in all the hot-houses, parterres, and orchards, the widespreading country could boast of. His gooseberries were still of the first kind, and when they were in season for eating, his garden was like a little fair on Sundays, with people tasting his mellow fruit. Such was the Dea-he is now in his narrow bed, poor man: the house where he lived is in ruins, his berry-bushes withered, and <pb n="163" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />covered with nettles, and robin-rin-the-hedge, while some of his "garden flowers" are now to be seen growing "wild." Yet the fond memory of some conjure up the rustic sage, and some of his shrewd remarks seem as if they were not going to be forgot. When the minister of his parish died, some of his warm friends thought of erecting a monument, with a suitable inscription thereon, to the memory of his departed Reverence, but ere doing this, they thought it would do no harm to have the Deacon's opinion on the matter, when he gave his showthers a hotch, and answered, "Wi' I ken na what ye wad say about him, but that he's there;” meaning, as much that his body lay there, and there required no more in justice to be said: so the idea of a monument was blasted by the Deacon's sarcasm. Though it was known that the Reverend gentleman was never much admired by him, as when he (the priest) met with our philosopher, at diets o' examine, it was always his way to set upon and question hard the Deacon, respecting the knotty points of our faith; yet even there, he could not get the better of him so well as he wished, as, whenever a cramp question was put, the Deacon would shake his head, and say, "He cud na cleverly tell that," the which answer compelled his Reverence to tell it himself. When asked by an acquaintance once what he thought of the sermons of the above-mentioned priest, if he considered them true to the point, or if he "backed weel out wi' Scripture ?" "I ken na (quoth the Deacon), he preaches loud-ay, he's loud," meaning as much that he made a noise, when speaking, and nothing more.</p>

                <p>When some Sutors in the Gate-house started from the stall, and began to harangue a multitude respecting their evil ways, the Deacon thought "Preaching would soon be gaun wi' water," like any other piece of mere machinery.</p>

                <pb n="164" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

                <p>His inquiries after the wonders of nature were of the first kind. The tides of the ocean, the thunder, the clouds, and the stars, cost him many reflections; and far did his mind penetrate into the ways of Providence. Wild too, did his fancy soar, and out of hale claith, as the saying is, he could shape a wonderful story. His imagination was perfectly exuberant; he not only knew the ways of men, and the various turns of nature, but he seemed also as if he had spent many a day with witches and warlocks; dined with water kelpies; and danced with fairies. With these visionary beings, he still seemed quite at home. By the strange tales he struck out, and the distance his mind was above his brother rustics, was he honoured with the title of Deacon: his christian name was James. He was a great artizan, as so were his sons, quite masters of all kinds of turning, centric and eccentric; they made distaffs and snuff-boxes, unmatched for handy craft.</p>

                <p>It may be said of the Deacon, as it is said of not a few, that he was gifted by nature with powerful talents, but blasted by the laws of Fortune.</p>

To the man of feeling, there is not a more horrible sight to be seen, as a fellow creature in this wretched state; how alive we are then to the power of death, and how grieved to the soul that we can render no relief. I was never able to stand the scene but once, and will never try it again, unless abruptly compelled. I do not think death itself will be more difficult for me to endure than that appalling scene <pb n="165" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />was. Once too, that restless being within me, Curiosity, dragged me to see the execution of a young man, when in Edinburgh, but she'll drag well if she drags me back again to see such a spectacle. I was not myself, Mactaggart, for a month afterwards, my mind was so disordered with the sight. In a curious way wrought the phrenzy (as I am one who speaks my mind), I tell this. I felt an inclination, both during night, when dream after dream whirled through my brain's airy halls, and in the day-time, to do some crime or other, that I might meet with a similar fate. Whether this is ever the way with I canother any person, not tell, but so it operated on me, and which has caused me ever since to say, that hanging, instead of scaring from crime, has a strong tendency the other way. May God keep me far from seeing again any in the dead-thraws.</p>

                <p>DE'IL'S CLUB-Many people fancy that the Devil carries a club with him wherever he wanders, and whatever object he is allowed to touch, from that moment it becomes his property, as when he touched the Man of Uzz anciently. Thus, at that season of the year called Michaelmas, he is said to touch with it the black-berries, or to "throw his club over them," none daring after that period to eat one of them, or the "worms will eat their ingangs." That boy too, who personifies an infernal being at Yule time, with face besmeared with soot or grime, and a sheep-skin belted round him with a straw rope "wooly side out, and fleshy side in," as the song of Bryan O'Linn goes, this boy bears in one of his hands a club, and in the other a fryingpan, as he rambles from house to house with his comrades, in white weeds; and, in one of his rhymes, thus describes himself</p>

There are many, however, who dread not either the auld boy nor his club, but are something, as the poet said of Ingleby, the female who lately astonished Scotland, by laughing at fire; her flesh remained unhurt in the strongest flame that could be made; she could too, lick with her tongue, a red gaud o' airn, and lap up a mouthful of boiling lead</p>

                <p>People should really be more afraid than they are of that pit wide yawning; and I myself should reflect oftener on the matter than I do, for I find I have not been an unco' gude boy.</p>

                <p>DE'IL'S NEEDLE-A large insect common in the latter end of summer. Its body and wings are about one length, that is, three inches. It haunts mosses and moors: it bites hard when caught, and is called adder-bell in some districts in Scotland. Some say it stings, but this it does not; and whether its bite be poisonous or no, I have not yet learned, nor do I know the name insectologists give it. Frequently two are seen flying together, and in conjunction. It is an insect not much beloved in the country, and tall men of a bad disposition, are not unfrequently called De'il's needles, and sometimes De'il's darning-needles. See, for more respecting them, in the article Robin Aree.</p>

                <p>There is something about this poem which reminds us of the tale of "Daft Jock M'Clean," so I may also give it. Jock was a curious enough human being; not altogether wise, and one could not say he was quite an idiot either; yet he was mostly allowed by all who had the honor of his acquaintance, to want a few pence of the shilling, as the saying is.</p>

                <p>Well, the fellow wandered about the nit-wuds and burnsides, and one lovely sunny summer evening he met with a certain Nobleman's daughter. This young woman was extremely bonny; her eyes bewitched poor Jock M'Clean the moment he saw them, and made him stand fast: so the wretch stood and gaped and panted, and glowered after the yellow hair'd maiden, until she went out of his sight past a turn on her walk. He went home to his mother in a sad state; love was burning him up alive. Sleep-he could get none; and how to have a kiss of the fair charmer, puzzled him much. At length he hit on a plan: he knew of a crab-tree in full bearing: he went and pulled the <pb n="171" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />fruit, and rowed them along the fair lady's accustomed walk, ending the row in a deep recess of the wood, in a dark binwud grove. The bait took; the lady, out strolling, seeing the crabs placed in this manner, followed the train away into the deep grove, where Jock lay in ambush to receive her. He clasped the sweet soul in his arms; she screamed; he kissed; she fainted-he let her fall, and ran. Some people working near by, hearing the cries of the young lady, came to her aid: soon they caught the poor daft fellow, who simply told the whole cause of the uproar. The lady pardoned and pitied him, saying, "That if he had come and told her what he wanted, he would have got it, without putting himself to so much trouble, and her in such jeopardy." For the fellow's craft, however, she gave him a suit of new clothes, and a more flashy fellow than he was, came not to the Belton Fair of Kirkcubrie that year, and some girls were not ashamed to admire Daft Jock M'Clean.</p>

            <p>DIET O' EXAMINE-An examination of honest Christians by their parish priest about religious matters, points of faith, grounds of salvation, what not. Wise priests examine now none at all; others, not so wise, or perhaps wiser, examine the youths of their flocks, a thing surely <pb n="172" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />quite right; and others, more foolish, still examine all" hand owre head," the young and the old, a thing in many respects very far wrong; nothing but impudent country-folks can answer properly any questions at these meetings. The modest, and they are still the great majority, can answer nothing: how can they; whenever they speak they are laughed at, and timidity debars them finding words for their ideas: yet still I think more of the religious principles of that person who can answer not a word, than of that who can. The one is mostly found to have the darling heart, and the heavenly light therein; the other we find to have goodness only "lip-deep." At these diets, the priest, and many of the heads of families, have a "diet" indeed, of good beef and greens, as they are mostly held at the wealthiest of the country people's houses.</p>

When all the players have done this, the one who has his hand on the board, pulls it out, and lays it on the one uppermost: they all follow again in rotation, and so a continual clashing or dashing is kept up; hence the name dish. Those who win the game are those who stand out longest, viz, those who are best at enduring pain. Tender hands could not stand it a moment: one dash of a rustic loof would make the blood spurt from the top of every finger.

            <p>DODJELL REEPAN-A beautiful wild flower common in marshy places. It is something of the figure of the feather in some soldiers caps; of a conical form; not unlike a head of Indian com, or a firrtap, the common colour of it is a lovely red, but sometimes it is seen white; its smell is very fine, and its root is of a bulbous nature, and very much like the body of an infant from the waist downwards. I have been thus particular, because I cannot find it hinted at in any books of botany that have fell in my way, and for some other causes which will just now be told. There are few districts in Scotland which have not their own name to this plant; in Annandale, and by the border, it is meadow rocket; in the west, and greater <pb n="175" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />part of Ireland, mount caper; the yirbwives, my famous herbalists, tell me that this yirb, above all others, should not be known to man; that's to say, its virtues should not be known to him; but as I have come to know what these virtues ascribed to this plant are, without these old females leave, and without promising to any one I should keep the important mystic, so I fail not to tell it.</p>

            <p>The roots of this herb then, when decocted, that is, boiled, and then mingled with a lukewarm lover's-meat, the female will get burning in love with the male who did it, although she was very indifferent about him before, as soon as she has swallowed the mixture, and will follow her object through thick and thin, in spite of all opposition, until she obtains her love adored. How far this holds true I cannot say; persons have been pointed out to me who have tried the same with success; and the tales respecting which are indeed wonderful pieces of fancy. But much 1 am inclined to think that this reepan or rocketjuice is a composition of mere nonsense; had there been any reality in it, I should not have been the first to give it to the world; for nothing of a hurtful nature to mankind shall come from me, if I am aware of it. Methinks this sap will aid Cupid nothing more than a sploit o' tobacco brew. There is a poem in my wallet, entitled "Something on the death O' Dodjell Reepan, a gamekeeper;" whether it is my own production or no I cannot exactly say; it smells something of my ugly fist. It may here be given, though there be nothing in it about the plant in question but the name;</p>

            <p>And Dodjell Reepan's dead and damn'd,</p>

            <p>The poacher's whistling do tell;</p>

            <p>And he's hung up on a nag to be ham'd,</p>

            <p>In the reekiest neuk o' hell.</p>

            <p>Mony a brute he laid fu' caul,</p>

            <p>Wi' his twa barrled gun;</p>

            <p>But death himsell at last did mul,</p>

            <p>DOMINIE-A schoolmaster. Dominie Hutchison o' Clauchenpluck, author of that learned work the Infant, price one penny. One of the rarest schoolmasters in Gallo<pb n="178" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />way, and quite an original. He is up to all the various branches of learning, and teaches his scholars on the natural plan; that is to say, whatever be the bent the Dominie checks it not; so his pupils become fond of him, and full of love. Many he fits out for college, and some kirks in Scotland have his pupils preaching in them.</p>

            <p>To his various lore he adds that of Esculapius; and the Dominie's medical skill is in high repute in the Moors. None can “bluid” with him; none can remove virulent so and so's, like he; and none can die without receiving a visit or two first from the Dominie. I conclude with him at present; but the article Peatnuik will bring the philosopher again on the carpet.</p>

        <entry>
            <p>DOOL-HILLS or DooN-HILLS.-There are several hills in Galloway whereon have stood castles and other strengths of yore, termed Dool or Doon-hills. These places of refuge seem to have existed prior to the Roman invasion, as the name Dool or Doon is never given to hills whereon are the remains of Roman camps; the labours of these hills then belong to the ancient British or some Scandinavian wanderers.</p>

            <p>DOOLS-A school game; and school games are by no means things unworthy observation, as many of them bespeak matters of the olden time; the one of dools then, amongst others, hints at something of this nature; the dools are places marked with stones, where the players always remain in safety-where they dare neither be caught by the hand nor struck with balls; it is only when they leave these places of refuge that those out of the doons have any chance to gain the game, and get in, and leave the doons they frequently most; this is the nature of the game. Now this game seems to have been often played in reality by our ancestors about their doon-hills.</p>

            <p>DOOL-STRING.-A piece of black crape put round the hat, to show the world we are in dool and sorrow; mourning deeply about the death of some dear friend or relative; the nearest of kin to the deceased have commonly the largest dool-strings. When this piece of fashion is considered a little philosophically, it shews itself a thing of vanity at once; those always feel the keenest sensations of grief who wear nothing of the kind. I have seen fellows with them hanging half down their backs, attending the funerals of their wives, who God knows if they felt very severely. Genuine sorrow is like charity, it detests all shew and ostentation. Some hypocrites never unrobe their chapeau of the dool-string, but keep it constantly on for years together, though in course of time it has changed its hue from black to brown, and become frumpled, like a piece of dry sea-weed.</p>

            <p>Auld Barrclye was a character somewhat of this kind; he used frequently to take a trip over to the Isle of Man in quest of cattle. In one of these rambles he was attended by a celebrated wag, nicknamed Sheerness; they had been riding out on little Manx ponies in search of their object one day, and were returning in the evening, to pass the night in the gay little town of Douglas, when Sheerness intimated to his friend Barrclye, that he would ride forward and see to find proper accommodations for them and their shelties, which was agreed on. Away scampered Mac, and on galloping up the principal street, he bawled out repeatedly to the populace, "To clear the street, Barrclye's coming;" which astonished the Manxmen much. They imagined by this that Barrclye must be a lord or duke, of mighty eminence, attended by a grand retinue; so they housed instantly, and filled every window, as anxious spectators of the coming scene. But lo! how were they deceived, when, instead of the glittering cavalcade their fancies had drawn, rode hobbling into the am<pb n="180" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />phitheatre Auld Barrclye. Hissing and hootings instantly began, followed by an attack on our old drover and his poney, who could not withstand the shock of rotten eggs with which they were assailed, gave way. Barrclye was unhorsed, and for once lost his old hat and dark brown dool-string.</p>

            <p>DOON-HEAD-CLOCK-A yellow flower common in the fields. When the flower fades away, a fine down is left behind on its head. Rustics, to know the time of the day, with their tale of it, pull this plant, and puff away at its downy head; and the number of puffs it takes to blow the down from off it is reckoned by them the time of the day. So comes the name Doon-head-clock.</p>

            <p>DOWN-SITTING-A place to sit comfortably down in. The lasses are often not very willing to wed lads who have not a down-sitting, like myself, to take them to; and a lad not unseldom looks out for a lass who has the blunt; one, which were he married to, he would have no trouble with, such as providing various things for pleneshing and taking up house; one whom he might just draw in his chair, and sit down, without giving himself any concern about the troubles of this world. Many of our auld Scotch sangs are nothing more than accounts of down-sittings, which our lads have from time to time laid before their dears, in order to entice them to marry, Allan Ramsey causes Roger, in his famous pastoral, to give Jennie an inventory "O'a' the woo' he did at Lammas sell,</p>

            <p>DRAIDGIE-A funeral entertainment. The following is a question, "Whether it is more proper to have a feast on a person's entering this world, than one when it bids farewell?"</p>

            <p>The case much depends on circumstances: if it be an heir to an estate that has made entrée, then a roaring feast over him cannot be thought improper; but if any other almost, it is not just reasonable to do so. Why should we rejoice at a being's coming into this world so full of sin, crime, trial, wretchedness, and woe? Surely, it is rather mockery to hail it with gladness into a land of sorrow. Was it into a paradise, the thing would be proper; and when it is a child of poor parents, the thing is a burlesque on common sense. On the other side of the question, an old bachelor, turning the corner, and leaving behind nothing that will miss him, is not unlike the heir in the other case. A good dredgie over him caunot be far wrong. Let the gossips take a hearty bumper over him, <pb n="183" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />and wish his soul a safe landing on the far distant shore: That shore to which many a Columbus sails for, but</p>

            <p>never returns.</p>

            <p>But if it be any other, the thing has not reason with it to say it is right; for all others almost will be missed and mourned for by some. Moreover, we know not how soon we shall follow, so should not be merry. Were we sure we should all go to Heaven when we died, then might we rejoice at the death of a friend; but this we are never sure of. The question therefore, nearly hangs on even balance:</p>

            <p>For not to be ashamed to live,</p>

            <p>Nor yet afraid to die,</p>

            <p>What would I not with pleasure give,</p>

            <p>If had the giving I.</p>

            <p>A million earths', if they were mine,</p>

            <p>Composed of solid gold,</p>

            <p>I'd give, without remorse or whine,</p>

            <p>To have my soul inrolled.</p>

            <p>Perhaps there is a den in Hell</p>

            <p>A fitting up for me,</p>

            <p>Where I eternally must yell</p>

            <p>In horrid misery.</p>

            <p>Never to have a moment's case,</p>

            <p>Nor feel one spring of joy,</p>

            <p>For torturing demons, who will tease,</p>

            <p>And all delights destroy.</p>

            <p>O! would some angel in mine ear</p>

            <p>This intimation sound</p>

            <p>"Mactaggart, thou ha'st nought to fear,</p>

            <p>"Heaven hath thee worthy found.</p>

            <p>"In patience wait a little time,</p>

            <p>"Soon thou shal't be at rest,</p>

            <p>DRAWING CUTS-Casting lots; pieces of straw or wood are cut of various lengths, according to the numbers that mean to try their luck. One then takes and arranges them in private, putting all their ends close together in one hand, so that none of them may project beyond one another; the other hand is laid on this, so that nothing may ́ be seen but the ends. So the drawing goes on, and the one who draws the longest cut is Jonah of the party. Bessie Bell and Mary Grey, they war sic bonny lasses, that their Joe, by Allan Ramsey's advice, draws cuts to know which he shall have.</p>

            <p>DREEL-To drill, to exercise soldiers. When volunteers lately started in every parish to defend the country, in case of a Bounaparte invasion, a country laird who commanded, or dreel'd a party of these raw military lads, used fre<pb n="185" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />quently to forget the technical words of command, when he had need of them, to the no small amusement of both his company and its spectators. Once, when the order should have been, "Rear rank, step forward," he cried out, forgetting the proper term, back raw stan forret. At another time, when "right about wheel" should have been the thing, he came out with the homely phrase, come roun' like a ligget. I should have liked to have heard this captain's orders at such a place as Waterloo.</p>

He is thought to be a youth of strength who can do this at fifteen years of age, and the rustics applaud him accordingly; though I would advise all young lads not to strain themselves for this praise, they will get no thanks for it when old age attacks them sooner than it should do, bringing with it a thousand evils, as they may plainly see if they look round them. Be not men, therefore, in any respect, until nature says it is full time.</p>

            <p>land now, and it would be well for the farmers of England if they did so also. It is the using a number of horses far more than needful, and employing a man more than enough to manage one plough. This man, or rather <pb n="186" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />boy, was called with us anciently, the "driver o' the pleuch," and had mostly a poor life of it from the ploughman, or the one who steered the plough, as, when any thing went wrong, the boy was always blamed. Sometimes these boys would have got angry, drove the horses fast, run the plough against rocks, and caused the crusty old ploughman to be flung breathless from the stilts, with a broken rib or so.</p>

            <p>DROWNING THE MILLER.-We are said to be drowning the miller, when we are pouring in too large a quantity of water among the whisky to be mixed into grog; and when we over-do the thing thus-we have drowned the miller; the phrase is very ancient, and comes from a just cause; if too much water be let run on a mill, the wheel becomes drowned, as it were, and will not move the machinery; now, if the big or outer wheel be drowned, the miller may be said to be also drowned, for he is flung, idle, and useless, when his mill will not work. "Dinna drown the miller then," ye who take grog by a time, <pb n="187" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />for it will render the machinery of your frames no good; swallow little water, and then the miller, which is in this case the heart, will not be drowned, but beat away quite active.</p>

            <p>DUM-SWAUL-Dumb-swell.</p>

            <p>A swell of the ocean, that maketh no noise; commonly these swells are the largest waves that are seen before storms and after them. Sailors dread no waves but those which curve at the top, or are made up of broken water. It is singular to see these large waves, called Dumb-swauls, when there is no wind, when the weather is quite calm, this is only though a little before the coming of the tempest. The cause is the undulating motion of the mighty waters; when this motion is given to the deep, it spreads over it much quicker than the hurricane which gives it; the storm enters the 66 wame o' the waves," as Eddie Ochiltree would saysilently it rolls on, till it encounters the rock-bound shore, and there in surges wild it roars. I wonder what makes this Eddie so often cross my mind, it is because he is the most poetical character ever Scott drew, and will live the longest of all his original family.</p>

It was that food our ancestors took about five o'clock in the evening, now designated by the title of four-hours, and being thus taken about the close or end, or shanks of e'en, or evening, the name E'enshanks arose. At an E'enshanks neither tea nor sugar made their appearance; no Indian nor Chinese spicery were to be seen. Magellan had then doubled Cape Horn, nor Gama, its brother, Good Hope.

                <p>EINING FOWK-The country people had a fashion some time ago of pairing the young folks about; that is to say, if a young man had taken a girl to be his partner at a dancing school, or if he had been seen speaking to one about the kirk-stile, or any other popular gathering, these two were instantly eind, evened to one another; and when a pair became thus eind, the very clash of the parish brought them soon to be cried. So this eining did some good to the cause of marriage. Now, however, people are got more hard i'the mouth, and set such a small value on clashes and sneers, that eining fowk becomes a vain trade. Manners, somewhat similar to these, will be found treated upon in the article-Gaun to a House. For sometime past, the matrimonial market has been far from being brisk, like many others, so that in some parishes a wedding has not taken place in a twallmonth, which is the space of a year in time :—</p>

They are called "elf-arrow-heads," because it was long thought they were the workmanship of elves, and used by them when shooting children, cows, what not. They were indeed used by curious elves, as in the 25th verse of Hardyknute</p>

            <entry>
                <p>ELFRINGS-On old pasture land, that slopes about at right angles to the rays of the Midsummer sun, circles, of all diameters, from three to thirty feet, are to be seen; and these circles are beautifully defined by a kind of white mushroom growing thickly all round the circumference, except about a foot or two in some; these spaces, unstudded with fungi, are called the "elfdoors," the openings by which the elves go into their circle or ring to hold the lightsome dance. As superstition crows over philosophy, when the latter is not able to point out the errors of the former, so with elfrings she has every reason almost to clap her wings, for no sage nor naturalist hath yet shewn the cause why these rings are formed. For my own part, I have marked the matter with all the attention I am capable of giving any thing, and yet must I own myself partly overcome with it. That they are formed by the solar rays, I doubt not a moment; no animal on the earth has any thing to do with their formation, because, on places where the ground is not of the same declivous nature, these rings deviate from the true circle, and the unevener the slope, the greater the variety of circles, or ellipses of va→ rious eccentricities; and where the rays strike at about a right angle to the plane, there they are of equal radii.</p>

                <p>But here comes the difficulty; if the figures and situations of the elfrings prove them to be the work of the sun's rays, how do the sun's rays produce them? Before the mushrooms grow, the grass of the ring seems as if it had been withered by a scorching heat; now, this must either proceed from lightning, or from the sun; that it proceeds not from the former is evident by the form of the rings, for mathematically it can be shewn, that on the plane where is described an ellipse, if that plane had been of the same angle with that on which is described a circle, that ellipse would have been a circle also, which seems to prove that the circles, let them be of what form they will, have all one grand centre, which is the sun, and that they <pb n="197" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />only vary because their planes vary. Lightning could singe out nothing of such regularity. About the summer solstice, the rings are first observed singed, and in August they get covered with mushrooms: this is a natural consequence, because wherever grass is singed or blasted, there start up clusters of the mushroom tribe.</p>

                <p>I have heard of coup-de-soleils or sun-blows of the tropical climates, and of people who have suffered by such blows; but I have never seen the account of any one respecting how the sun inflicts them, and am inclined to think that the way in which he does the one, he also does the other. Were there for instance a ray of the Midsummer's sun confined in a tube, and the motion of this ray marked, on the hillside, from his rising until his going down, I am almost sure that we would behold the manner in which the grass is scorched and the circles struck out. But I leave the matter until future observations can be made. As for the elves having any thing to do with them, is at least rustic nonsense; let the superstitious hold it out</p>

                <p>Like the mermaid and unicorn,</p>

                <p>Talk'd oftener about than seen,</p>

                <p>Are warlocks and worricows,</p>

                <p>And elves upon the green.</p>

                <p>They all are cattle that</p>

                <p>Do feed upon the Fancy's farm,</p>

                <p>And they love those fancy pastures best</p>

                <p>The poet's nowt they truly are,</p>

                <p>And if he keeps them fu' and hale,</p>

                <p>He will meet with a sale.</p>

                <p>But if they are not fat and good</p>

                <p>His sale will be but small,</p>

                <p>The critic butchers sneer at him,</p>

                <p>They will not sell at all.</p>

                <p>For their beef, when lean is bad,</p>

                <p>It will not take the salt and keep,</p>

                <p>And it plays the curse with honest folks,</p>

                <p>ELLWAN' O' STARRS-Those three bright stars of the first magnitude, or at least of the second, in the northern constellation Lyra, the harp, I believe, if memory can be depended on. These stars are among the most obvious to naked eyes of any that bestud the welkin. Them, and the "Cluster," as the country people call the constellation of Orion, the Hunter, and "Peter's Pleuch," otherwise Ursa Major, or the Big Bear, strike at once the most rustic of astronomers, and have struck them more than the rest in all ages. In the ancient poetic Book of Job a verse says, "Cans't thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?"</p>

                <p>Now, what are the Pleiades, but those seven bright stars in the constellation of the Big Bear above mentioned, called, some time ago, Charly Wain, but more anciently, Peter's Pleuch, and Orion, the Cluster?</p>

                <p>These stars then which draw the attention of men in all ages deserve particular consideration, and none more so in my opinion, than these three, called by the Scotch the "Ellwand," from their seeming to the eye to be about equally distant from other, and in a straight line. Who knows yet but this ellwand may indeed be used as an ellwand for measuring all over the earth. It is long now since an universal standard, for measuring has been called for by the philosophic world, and none to give satisfaction hath yet been produced. The earth has been actually measured with a chain, I may say, from Pole to Pole, for this purpose chiefly; and the great complaint always is, the changeableness of the works of nature. The earth alters of itself; the Poles flatten away, the Equator keeps swelling out, the large luminaries of heaven are always altering in size and situation with respect to the earth, and nothing but the stars in any propriety can be said to be fixed.</p>

                <p>From them then let a standard for measuring be taken, one which will not alter, and one whose original may be easily referred to by all nations. And what shall we better get than the " Ellwand o' Starrs," a measurement held out to us by nature as it were. Let the apparent length of this ellwand be taken, either by beads on a line, or holes in a flat slip of wood, and so we may form an universal ellwand. The natives of Iceland, Tombuctoo, Pekin, Washington, and London; yes, the great body of the inhabitants of the earth, be their situations on it where they will, will understand by this at once the foundation of the measure, for the constellation in which is the "ellwand" being Orion's Girdle (nigh the range of the ecliptic); it may be seen every uncloudy night by mostly all men on the globe.</p>

                <p>ENLANG-Endlong. I have heard country people frequently discussing about the propriety of these sayings; the first is, "I came owre the brig." This is wrong they argue, it should be, I came enlang the brig, the other meaning as much that I went over the side of it or ledge, and into the river. Now, both expressions are perfectly right. I came over the bridge, and I came endlong the bridge, are one and the same thing; for why not as well come over the bridge as the road comes, as go over its side. Secondly, "It is not right to say we are going up when we are going south; we should always say down to the south, and up to the north."</p>

                <p>Now it is not proper nor right to say whether we are either going up or down when going either south or northward. There is no occasion to add either the one or the other. Up and down refers to high and low; and the south is just as high as the north.</p>

                <p>EPPIE-The female name Euphemia. Who ever heard my old witch, Eppie Foggiehorn, sing</p>

                <p>O! my love was a fairy,</p>

                <p>And could dance round the moon,</p>

                <p>My path, too, was airy,</p>

                <p>In the welkin aboon :</p>

                <p>But a damn'd worricow</p>

                <p>O! strike her a skirl,</p>

                <p>FAICHLOCHS or FAISHOCHS.-Sorry working labourers; always seeming busy, yet putting little work past them. FAIR-FARRAND-Open, free, inclined to flattery. FAIRIES-These beings are yet often to be seen and heard of in the south of Scotland. One came to a gudewife once, and wished her to give an "awmons" of meal. The mistress complained she had little meal in the house. "Gie ay, (quoth the fairie) a part o' what ye hae to a poor body, and ye'll never lose." The wife obeyed her, and, continued the fairy, "sae lang as ye never look into the girnel ye shall ay bring plenty o' meal out o' it wi' your hand." She did so for some time, but one day feeling a curiosity to behold the exhaustless store, she looked in, and there was an empty girnal; so ever afterwards she had to fill it herself.</p>

                <p>Another time a man met on an evening a funeral. The people with it seemed fatigued, and desired the honest man" to tak a lift o' the corpse." "I'll do that (quoth he) in gude's name," which he had no sooner said than they all disappeared, leaving him with an empty coffin.</p>

                <p>The man died soon after. This was a Fairy Funeral.</p>

Barool, the chief mount in the Isle of Man, is somewhat like it, but not so sounding; and as for Etna, Heckla, or mount Blanc, they have nothing to say to it on this score; even Chimborazo, the loftiest in the world, has not a more lofty name.</p>

                <p>FINNIE. A feel with the hand, or ratherly a feel which returns with good tidings to the senses; persons purchasing grain, generally estimate the price of it, by its finnie, or the way in which it feels:</p>

                <p>"A wat May and a winnie,</p>

                <p>"Bring a fu' stack-yard and a finnie."</p>

                <p>The meaning of which is, that a wet and windy May month, is such weather that makes crops grow good; so that they fill the stack-yard, and the grain feels weel.</p>

                <p>FIPPLE. The underlip; when dull about any thing, we are said to "hing the lip;" and when those around wish us rouzed, they say we would answer well for eating Peelock potatoes; for why? we might be cooling one in our fipple, while eating another.</p>

                <p>FLEEING-BUSS.-A rapid burning fire is said, to go like a fleeing-buss, or a whin-bush on fire; for when one of these bushes is set fire to in a windy day, we think by looking at, that the blaze is, as it were, taking the bush with it, before really it has it consumed; hence fleeing-buss, or fleeing, flaming-buss. The cause of this optical delusion is, that by looking at a rapid burning fire, our eyes dazzle; they mount with the flame, as it were, and take with them the what feeds it also-it is just refraction; we see the sun, after he is in truth set.</p>

                <p>FLICHTERS.-Light flying flakes, such as of snow; when the snow, at the first of a storm, is like fine dust, as it comes from the air, it is a sure sign that the storm is going to be one of long continuance, but if the flichters be broad, it will upple sooner. It is the same way with the drops of rain. Rain never falls in large drops long, and never falls in large drops at all, unless there is much heat in the atmosphere. For warm water runs through a sieve much sooner than cold; from this we may infer the cause of the severe snow storm, when it begins to fall like dust, or what is called "snastowre:" for then a most intense cold prevails, caused by a frosty air, and dense clouds.</p>

                <p>FORE-NICHTS. The fore part of the winter nights; in summer there are no fore-nichts. They are the spaces of time between gloaming and going to bed; spaces taken of the long nights, and added to the short days, as it were. But of all the hours which wing their way over a peasant's head, none are so dear to him as those of the forenichts. For if he has a wife and family, then he may be said to enjoy them and be happy. If he be a bachelor of social disposition, then he is out at parties amongst is neebours, or some of them are with him; and if he be of a studious habit, then he may read books, enjoy himself with feasting on literature, and pondering the abstruse sciences.</p>

                <p>Many a famous self-taught scholar the fore-nights have made in Scotland; many a notable tale and song they have produced; they are the delights of all classes of kintra folks, to none more so than lovers, and the rare <pb n="209" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />sons of rustic genius; these latter revel in extacy during this season.</p>

                <p>Wunnaing, otherwise cleaning corn; knitting stockings, muffetees, and loofies, cobbling shoon, and what not, may somewhat run contrary to the employments of pleasure; yet, still the joy of joys is to be found in the lang wunter fore-nichts.-Dear to my soul is the country; long was I a Ruricola.</p>

                <p>O! but I love the country well,</p>

                <p>But true I love its labour ill,</p>

                <p>Sweet 'tis in rural world to dwell,</p>

                <p>But sour to mow, and shear, and till.</p>

                <p>And this proceeds all from the heart,</p>

                <p>For some delight to sweat and toil,</p>

                <p>Dear nature scorn-and relish art,</p>

                <p>Poor greedy grubworms of the soil.</p>

                <p>They never hear the burdies sing,</p>

                <p>They never feel the evening breeze,</p>

                <p>In vain, for them primroses spring,</p>

                <p>Or leaf, in majesty the trees.</p>

                <p>Give them the what their kytes will cram,</p>

                <p>Or lumps of ore to fill the purse-</p>

                <p>They want no more, all else they damn,</p>

                <p>What I consider joy, they curse.</p>

                <p>But let ilk man, pursue his plan,</p>

                <p>FREETS. Superstitious observances, with respect to omens good or bad, more commonly bad; the greater part of which now a-days, though they be observed, are not paid great attention to; yet, on the whole, they are ratherly respected. A cup o'saut is yet put on a corpse, from the time it is straughted until it be coffined; also the dead are waked with great solemnity. The shoes are yet twisted of the hoofs of mares before they bring forth their young, and they are by no means allowed to foal in stables. An horse-shoe is put thrice through beneath the belly, and over the back of a cow that is considered elfshot. Elfgirse is given to this cow; a burning peat is laid down on the threshold of the byre door; she is set free from her stake, and driven out; if she walks quietly over the peat, she remains uncured; but if she first smells, then lets a spang over it with a billy, she is then shaned, cured. If at the funeral one at the handspakes misses his foot, and falls beneath the bier, he will soon be in a coffin himself. If we are on the way to rid an errand, yet forget something, we will have no luck that day. A hare, to cross our path, is a bad omen. If a knife be found lying open on the road, few will dare to lift it. Even a preen, if the broadside is not found lying towards the face, will not be touched. A broom or cow is thrown after curlers, when they leave a house; this is shaning them good luck, and the blue dead lights, which appear before a death, what omens are they; these lights are seen in the air, about the height a corpse is carried, and bobbing up and down, the undulating motion of corpse bearers: they are seen to leave the house where the person is to <pb n="211" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />die, and go to the grave where the interment will take place; to kep these lights is not right conduct; a man did so once, when the corpse came to that place on its journey to the grave, there a fear came over the burial folks, they could not move farther, until the man told the tale of the dead light; three things are ay sonsy, but why need I note so? I could tell more than a hundred, without being any way exhausted; let these be a swatch, however, I shall still continue saying a little more on the subject with respect to those freets, which come from one generation to another, in the shape of little rhymes:</p>

                <p>"Sit and see, the swallow flee,</p>

                <p>"Gang and hear the gowk yell, "See the foal afore its minnies e'e,</p>

                <p>"And luck that year will fa' thysell."</p>

                <p>Which means, when we are sitting, the first time we see the swallow flying; walking, when we first hear the cuckoo; and the first foal we meet with, if it be before the eyes of its mother, that will be a fortunate year. The great anxiety young women are in to know any thing about the husbands they are to have, gives rise to numberless freets; one of these is, when the new moon is first beheld, they sally out to the green braes in bevies, and there each pull a handful of grass, saying, at the same time,</p>

                <p>"New moon, true moon, tell me if ye can,</p>

                <p>"Gif I hae here a hair like the hair o' my gude man.” Viz. Among the grass pulled, which is carefully searched, and if a hair be found among it, which is generally the case, the colour of that hair determines the hue of the expected gude man's.”</p>

                <p>The three first days of April are called borrowing days, and the freets of them run so</p>

                <p>"March borrows frae April</p>

                <p>"Three days, and they are ill;</p>

                <p>"The first o' them is wun and weet,</p>

                <p>"The second it is snaw and sleet,</p>

                <p>"The third o' them's a peel-a-bane,</p>

                <p>"And freezes the wee burds neb tae stane."</p>

                <pb n="212" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA212#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

                <p>Magpies cause other curious freets, according to the number of them seen at any one time together.</p>

                <p>"Ane's sorrow-Twa's mirth,</p>

                <p>"Three's a burial-Four's a birth,</p>

                <p>"Five's a wedding-Six brings scaith,</p>

                <p>"Seven's sillar-Aught's death."</p>

                <p>A mist about the last day's of the moon's age, brings with</p>

                <p>it a freet.</p>

                <p>"An auld moon mist,</p>

                <p>"Never dees o' thrist."</p>

                <p>It is said of February</p>

                <p>"That February fills the dyke,</p>

                <p>"Either wi' the black or white."</p>

                <p>And of Candlemas day</p>

                <p>"Gif Cannelmas day be fair and clear,</p>

                <p>"We'll hae twa wunters in that year."</p>

                <p>And "Gin the Laverock sings afore Cannlesmas, she'll mourn as lang after't."-I conclude with the following bunch of freets:—</p>

                <p>"Grumphie smells the weather,</p>

                <p>"And Grumphie sees the wun,</p>

                <p>"He kens whan 'cluds will gather,</p>

                <p>"And smoor the blinking sun;</p>

                <p>"Wi' his mouth fu' o' strae,</p>

                <p>"He to his den will gae;</p>

                <p>"Grumphie is a prophet, wat weather we will hae."</p>

                <p>"Whan we steer the greeshoch,</p>

                <p>"Gif the lowe be blue,</p>

                <p>"Storms o' wun and weather,</p>

                <p>"Will very soon ensue."</p>

                <p>"Whan flares o' Easlin light,</p>

                <p>"As the sun starts frae his bed,</p>

                <p>"Make the cluds a bluidy sight,</p>

                <p>"Changing them frae blue to red,</p>

                <p>"Or the blazing cheel wuns owre,</p>

                <p>FRENCH BUTTERFLEES.-The common white butterflies the Pontia of learned insect men, I believe, and of the <pb n="213" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />class Lepidoptera; when war raged between this country and France, our patriotic youths hunted these poor butterflies over hill and dale, armed with whun cows, and destroyed as many of them as they possibly could; having the idea that they really were from France, and being of the colour of the French flag, white, decided the matter. The red butterfly was called the British one, the Apatura of naturalists; it was venerated; to slay one of them was considered a horrid crime.</p>

                <p>FYAAM O' AULD GLENS-It is a thing quite impossible for me to express the meaning of this fyaam, or fume proceeding from old glens, except to keen naturalists, who have felt it. It is the scent of Melancholy, as it were, in her abode in lonely glens. So soon as the smelling organs feel it, the soul is alive to all the charms of solitude, and to unutterable objects in the wild bosom of nature. It is a something like the poet's "Hollow hum in the dark green wo de."</p>

                <p>"There is a pleasure in the pathless wood,</p>

                <p>"There is a rapture on the lonely shore"-Sayeth Byron.</p>

                <p>And Byron is a wild strong bard, with some little errors hanging about him, thought great by some, whereas the truth is, they are the mere dust on the sandal soles of mighty Madam Genius.</p>

                <p>What curse is this within my brain.</p>

                <p>Which sinks me thus so gloomy sad,</p>

                <p>With beating heart, and head in pain,</p>

                <p>Upon the point of running mad?</p>

                <p>Am I a sinner black and bad,</p>

                <p>And know not how I can repent,</p>

                <p>Knew I my crime, I would be glad,</p>

                <p>And bear with peace my punishment,</p>

                <p>But what I am, I know not the extent.</p>

                <p>My mind, I feel's a mighty wilderness,</p>

                <p>A mass of something quite irregular,</p>

                <p>Which sadness wisheth to compress;</p>

                <p>But o'er the world 'twill stretch afar,</p>

                <p>Tho' alligators fling their jaws ajar,</p>

                <p>And snap their tusks in fell array.</p>

                <p>Beyond yon moon, ay, and yon argol star,</p>

                <p>Will fancy wing her sunward way,</p>

                <p>And scorn the clouds that would befoul the day,</p>

                <p>Shall savage man, with all his gold,</p>

                <p>Be fit to clip the poet's wings.</p>

                <p>Or turn his heart by freezing cold,</p>

                <p>And cut its tenderest feeling strings?</p>

                <p>All what's not independant he doth spurn.</p>

                <p>O! happy he again would be,</p>

                <p>Sweet nature's self but to adore.</p>

                <p>But oh, how mad, how sick and sore,</p>

                <p>O! would this withering gale blow o'er,</p>

                <p>And let the rustic bard go rove,</p>

                <p>Singing his song, and trusting in his God above.</p>

                <p>How wavering is the human mind; full of changes. Melancholy gives it strength; all great minds have felt a great deal of melancholy-from gloominess to gaiety how swiftly it alters.</p>

                <p>GALLOWA-A large district or shire, ranging along the south of Scotland, anciently much larger than now, stretching, in the days of yore, from the English border to the Irish Firth, a distance of more than a hundred miles. Its breadth has not varied much, being naturally cut off, as it were, from the rest of Scotland, by a range of wild bleak moors. This has continued much the same. It had its own kings once; Galdus or Galders, whose tomb and name yet exist in the country, was one of them, and it is thought Galloway had its name from him, which is not unlikely. Murray, in his literary account of the district, quotes various authorities respecting the name, and in this, shows considerable genius and research, though, as to the true derivation, it yet remains doubtful. The manners, customs, and language of the peasantry differing widely from those belonging to the rest of Scotland, I was induced to say something respecting them, being fond of curiosity, and I have not confined myself to the Galloway of modern days, but to the ancient Gallovadia, Gallwallia, or Gallwegia, for doing which, if any thank me, it is well, and if none do so, I have myself to thank, which I do with boldness; because, in saying what I have said, I have felt great pleasure, so should thank myself that I found out this little source of happiness; and even had those manners and what not, not differed so widely as they do from their neighbours, still I would have said something respecting them, not that I may know matters that the world knows not, and perhaps cares little about, and not that I like to hear myself talking, but just to show, that the peasants, though an extremely modest race, have bred one amongst them full of impudence.</p>

                <p>GAUN to a HOUSE-About forty or fifty years ago, visiting in the country was a very serious matter; that is to say, there was no such thing as kintra neebours going to see how other were at their houses, unless there was some urgent business in hand between the parties, and even if there were, the visitor would seldom go into the house, but execute his mission, or what not, on the green in the open air; for if he had, he would not have come out again, if a young man, without having himself eind with one of the daughters of that establishment, which being done, marriage had to ensue. The natives waited for the pair to be cried every Sabbath-day that came, in the kirk, and if no proclamation took place, the fellow was badgered and bantered about the girl where ever he went; at shoot<pb n="220" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />ings, kirns, prentice-loosings, &amp;c. The poor lassie would never be matched to another; so his soul would give way to the foolish scandal and country clash afloat, and he would enter the matrimonial state to get clear of them; thus, gaun to a house, as it was called, proved to be a sad matter often, if the lads and the lasses had not previously engaged other at kirk-stiles, or some such famous courting houfs or haunts.</p>

                <p>GEORDIE WUSHART-An eminent rustic bard, and one of the most honest and social of men. He is chief salmonfisher on the Dee, but was born and bred somewhere on the Scottish border. In his ways all—he is quite an original; every motion of either his body or mind attests it. He <pb n="221" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA221#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />can tell the most humorous tale without giving a single smile with his countenance: he will have all around him in a roar of laughter, and himself sitting the while as serious as Socrates. He is one of the most patient and contented men on earth, nor is this happy temper annoyed by him having a hell of a woman for a wife, as the unfortunate sage lately mentioned had, for, on the contrary, she is a worthy and amiable female."</p>

                <p>As to his poetic talents, few there are who have the pleasure of estimating them, as they have not yet been fairly laid before the world's mycroscopic eye; but I; for one, have been honoured with a peep at his MSS. in their present state, so am able to say what I think of them, which, without the "decimal fraction of a doit'sworth of flattery, I say they are extremely natural and pleasant, and ought to have got a squeeze in the press long ago." There is not much wildness and madness about them; they are simple and halesome, not unlike the strain of Allan Ramsay.</p>

                <p>His General Review and Eternal Almanack are indeed superior to most rustic poems in my knowing. Their plots, and the way in which they are handled, prove Geordy to be a man of genius. He is not only a poet, but a very clever mathematician, understanding Algebra well, and can engrave beautiful sun-dials. I once sent him a dial of rather a singular construction, when he thanked me as follows:</p>

                <p>I gat the dial that ye sent,</p>

                <p>It was ane handsome compliment,</p>

                <p>And thanks are due on cent. per cent.</p>

                <p>In gratitude frae Geordy.</p>

                <p>I ne'er saw ought like it afore,</p>

                <p>I glowered at it owre and owre,</p>

                <p>The farer I did it explore,</p>

                <p>It gaed mair joy to Geordy.</p>

                <p>Though there may be rather too much sweet oil in these thanks, yet any one of penetration may see they flow from a tender and good heart. In truth, there is no man more beloved by all who know him than Geordy. His honest face brightens up every company he is in; whether that company be in the Hall o' Barniewater, Auld Ned's Antichamber, or St. Cuthbert's Mason Lodge. He is fond of shooting, and in Galloway there is none can wield a double barrlie so well as Geordy. When the game springs, whether on foot or wing, he takes a snuff deliberately, brings the gun quitly up to his e'e, lets fly, and if he misses, it is a wonder. But, to give a further proof of his poetic powers, and firstly then, a piece, entitled</p>

                <p>GERROND the POET-What a difference there is between this bard, and the one just sketched. John Gerrond the gow, and George Wishart the sage. The first, an honor to <pb n="224" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA224#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />the Muses, the other a disgrace. He was bred a blacksmith; went to America; drank and frolicked in the world beyond the flood; came back again, tilting over the white top'd surges of the Gulf of Florida, to use his own language, then published at various times stuff he termed poems; shameless trash, appearing as if they had been dug out of the lovely bosom of an Assmidding.</p>

                <p>For all there is much about him deserving my attention. Some genuine madness, vanity, and folly; and I will dare to say, that if he had had ten times more industry than what he has, he would have wrote some tolerable verses, as his madness is ratherly that of a poet's. In truth, his Red Lion Frolic is as fine a specimen of gowishness as I have seen. He says he is the first of Vulcan's sons who strives to climb the sliddery brae, and that as music was first produced by striking on an anvil, he expects that even something greater yet may be produced in a smiddy, and that nothing ever came from those whose ears hear little but the chirping of the yarn-beam. Indeed, was not the tender Tannahall a weaver; poor Gerrond, I won't hurt thee, thou hast been injured much already by the destiny of thy stars; for Burns, you say, was very lucky in appearing at the time he did. He got just the start of you by a few years, and took up all those subjects which was befitting your muse just so; but if he had never wrote, neither would ye have done so, nor ever have thought that Halloween and the Holyfair were frolics that a poet could make exist to eternity; so Gerrond is a strange creature, and perhaps there never was any being moved about more independent than he in clogs and a ruffled sark, for which he has my highest praise; for poverty, in all its shapes, he values nothing. Give him a glass or two of whisky, and he would not call the king his cousin; and no one deserves a glass more than he, for he both loves it dearly, and will give thanks for it either in clink or other<pb n="225" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />ways.

                <p>While ranging for subscribers once through the country, a priest was so impudent as to tell him he was no poet. "Don't you think (returned our hero), that the Almighty is as potent now as he was in the days of old?" Surely, (replied the priest.) "Wi than (quoth Gerrond), he has opened the mouth of another ass to-day, methinks." This retort was not so far amiss; on the whole, he is a harmless soul, and reels about like a true poet, contented, in rags, and commonly as fow as the Baltic. It is far from me to discourage the efforts of genius; I am quite on the side of a young poet, if I have any penetration to see he is on the right side o' the dyke; but, hoh, ho, Gerrond was never there, and is too old now to speil over. Merit will work its way, under a million disadvantages, to the Temple of Fame; nothing else will do. But oh!</p>

Though they be cried three times, if the three cryings be put all past on one day, as is now commonly the case, the Precentor's loof must be better creeched than if he took three separate days to it, which is the strict point of church law. Those names are generally The parties meet in a pub given in on a Saturday night. lic house; no females attend; the father or brother of the bride is her representative; the bridegroom is present, and his best man, on the Precentor being called in to the meeting (a business he generally likes, as he gets plenty both to eat and drink for nothing), the names are wrote down on a slip of paper; the bride's name by one of her relations present, and the bridegroom's by his man; after this is done, the bowzing goes merrily on; the whisky punch dashes about like dishwater; all present get fuddled, and the Precentor worst of all, as fow as a witch.</p>

A gill, a glen, a cleugh, and a haugh, are all of the same family, but differing in magni<pb n="227" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />tude, all excavations of this planet caused by the running of water.</p>

                <p>GILL-A leech. This word, and "gell" are one, for the leech is a creature that makes "gells" in the flesh. The word gell, I am not sure whether it is of Norman or Erse extraction; I am inclined to think the latter. If cream be rubbed on those parts of the body where leeches are to be put, they will take hold sooner than without it. The bite of a leech is poisonous when newly taken out of its native place they should be kept some time before used; the water they are put in should be changed every day, and that water should be much of the nature of their native water, of an half putrid nature, for it is on the viewless animals of this water they live. Spring water is death to them, and they should have, if possible, fresh air. A bottle is not a good thing to keep them in; it should be a wider vessel, with a lid holed like a sieve.</p>

                <p>The wound they make is of a singular shape, something like the letter Y; three legs striking off from a centre, having the angle of sixty degrees between them. Nature, thou art a wonderful mathematician; what wound would answer so well as one of this form, both for letting out blood, and healing soon. Like the bees, with their hexagonal combs, no other solid would answer them so well. Leeches deserve attention; when we wish them to vomit, nothing but their mouths should touch the salt.</p>

These are commonly old women: they wade about with their coats kilted high; the vampires lay hold of them by the legs, when the gill-gatherers take them off, and bottle them up. These persons have commonly a long stick, called a gill-rung, with them. When they come to a deep hole, they plunge in it with this, and start the leeches, singing a strange song at the same time to the <pb n="228" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />rouses of the pole.

Sae up I brought him slowly, the biggest fluik ever I saw; nae common pan wad hae ta'en him in at hauf a dizzen times. I brought him safely intae boat; he had swallowed the bait greedily, the huik was sticking in his 'ginners.' I took out my knife, ripped up his un'er-jaw, to get back the huik; but just as I lifted him, to fling aft a bit, lord! he gaed a de'il's wallop, slipped out o' my han', and o'er the <pb n="230" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />gunnel o' the boat again intae water. I let dive after him wi' my arms to the oxters, but he slided awa. O! I was vexed; I drew up the penter, gaed awa ashore to Meg wi' the tear in my eye. Sinsyne, I hae thought it was na a fleuk, but some watch in the shape o' ane, may be, Eppie Hanna, gif that be sae, she has sair ginners the day, be she whar she wull.</p>

                <p>GLED'S-NESTS-Nests of the kite. These are common in moorland glens: they build there on what the shepherds call scurrie thorns, low dwarfish thorns; and these nests, when young gleds are in them, are kept well filled with mice and moles, which proves that this bird not only preys on animals of its own tribe, but on quadrupeds. It is a greedy bird, the kite, and extremely useless in bearing up against the rudeness of winter; one would think, that when the frost and snow reduced the little birds to a sad forlorn state, that those of prey would then be feasting. This is not so, though; a mark of the wisdom of Providence : cold sets upon the prowling vagabonds in a manner that naturalists have not found out; for, frequently in winter, they not only want strength of wing to catch their prey, but can neither kill nor eat it when it is catched, as I have often seen proved.</p>

One of the largest of the boys steal away from his comrades, in an angry like mood, to some dyke-side or sequestered nuik, and there begins to work as if putting a pot on a fire. The others seem alarmed at <pb n="232" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />his manner, and gather round him, when the following dialogue takes place :</p>

                <p>They say first to him,</p>

                <p>What are ye for wi' the pot, gudeman?</p>

                <p>Say what are ye for wi' the pot?</p>

                <p>And our necks draw and thraw?</p>

                <p>He answers,</p>

                <p>Your minnie burdies ye maun lae,</p>

                <p>Ten to my nocket I maun hae,</p>

                <p>Am no sae saft, Gled-wylie, ye'll fin' me bauld and teugh.</p>

                <p>After these rhymes are said, the chickens cling to the mother all in a string. She fronts the flock, and does all she can to keep the kite from her brood; but often he breaks the row, and catches his prey. Such is the sport of Gled-wylie.</p>
            </z> GLENKENS-A glen amongst rocks. This is the largest

            <p>"</p>

            <p>and wildest glen in Galloway, extending into many parishes. In the heart of it is the Loch o' Ken, a lovely lake, Newgalloway Clauchan, and the ancient seat of the Gordons of Kenmore. It is a most romantic place: it was on his way through it (in riding from Dumfries to Gatehouse), that Burns composed the chief of national songs, "Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled." He did this during a storm of rain: the storm, and the wild situation in which it catched the poet, must have aided those uncommon <pb n="233" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA233#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />manly breathings of the song to burst forth. He was accompanied in his journey by his friend, Mr. Sims, who wrote out the story. Galloway, then, must have some share in the honour of giving birth to the famous effusion, and a small share even, is surely a great honour.</p>

            <p>GLENT TO gleam suddenly, or a sudden gleam of light. GLIBB-Quick, sharp, more so than needful. A person too quick, as it were, for the world, or "glibb,” is generally disliked.</p>

            <p>GLIFF-A transient view of any thing.</p>

            <p>GLISK-A glimpse of light. A little light flung suddenly on a dark object. Gliff is the short view; glisk, the little light which gave the short view.</p>

            <p>GOOSETS-Pieces of cloth set in at certain angular points</p>

            <p>of clothing, so that they may better befit the body. Little out-lets, as it were, well known to the sewers of white</p>

            <p>GORLINS or GORBS-Young birds.</p>

            <p>GORROCH-TO mix and spoil porridge, or such food. GOTH. An exclamation, and a bad one, for it is no less than a molification of the sacred word God; goth man, goth ay, goth this, and goth that, are by far too common sayings; many are led to prologue their words by them, who know not the meaning of the language they are using; let all desist from tampering with this word in the time to come; let goth become obsolete, so will we be respecting the name of our Almighty Creator; also, let haith, which is used for faith, sink to oblivion.</p>

            <p>Gou-A bad taste or smell.</p>

            <p>GOURLINS-The black bulbous roots of an herb with a</p>

            <p>white bushy flower, good to eat, called Hornecks in some parts of Scotland.</p>

            <p>GOW.-A name for a fool. ·</p>

            <p>GOWDIE.-Mr. John Goldie, a young gentleman, for some time editor of the "Ayr and Wigtonshire Courier,” born and bred in Ayrshire, but being the manager of this newspaper, and it having ado with part of Galloway, of course it behoves me to take notice of him. And I do this with much pleasure, for why, I consider my friend very worthy of it, he is a poet, that's enough; yes, and a poet too, agreeable to my taste, as also I should think of every peasant in Scotland; and I would much rather be a bard that could kittle up the feelings of the country folks, than one who was a favourite at court; but the truth is, a peasant's poet is also a prince's, for who are not moved with the mellow voice of nature? it thrills through the breast enstarred, as quick as through that covered with the corner of a plaid; it works its way to the heart, be that heart in what situation it may. Mr. Goldie has certainly much of the right ore about him, ready to be brought forth, and (without much amalgamation with other metals), stampt in that mint, which issues out the genuine coin that endures for ages. Lately he published a volume of sweet little pieces, some of them reminded me not a little of the strain of Tom Moore. He is the author of that song which took such a hold of the stage in the days of dandyism, and partly helped to bring these toy-shop gentry into ridicule; it begins with, as many know,</p>

            <p>There's the wealthy widow Watt,</p>

            <p>She's as ugly as her cat,</p>

            <p>She's toothless, dull of hearing, crooked and bandy O!</p>

            <p>Tho' her skin's as dark as my hat,</p>

            <p>Yet her cash can cover that,</p>

            <p>For the cash you know's the thing that's for the dandy O.</p>

            <p>When editor of the newspaper, he was the means of bringing many a gem out of the gulf of oblivion; he lent not a deaf ear to the whisperings of Genius, but freely gave the goddess a corner whenever he heard her voice. He was one of <pb n="236" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA236#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />the chief instruments by which was completed with so much eclat on the banks o' bonny Doon, a monument to the memory of Burns, or ratherly a land-mark to guide the pilgrim in after ages to the venerable Kirk Allowa; as also the one who constituted an Ayr Burn's Club, to commemorate the anniversary of the bard in his native town; on the whole, this gentleman's conduct has not been unlike that of Mr. M'Diarmid's Dumfries, to be afterwards spoken of; he has the love of mankind and literature at heart; is like myself now driving away in London, so God speed the wark, and ever sing " success to the cause." I may here treat my readers to an effusion of his muse, never before in print :</p>

            <p>Such a Poem is not amiss; I am in love with the Poet, and intend, some day or other, to publish his works, which I have beside me; I am going to write to him, in America, such a genius should not be kicked to a corner. GOWK-SPITTLES.-A white frothy matter, common on the leaves of plants about the latter end of the summer, and beginning of autumn; in the interior of these spittles, a little insect is always found, some say a young cleg, or gad-fly, and that it lives on this froth until it be strong enough to hop elsewhere; these spittles are said to be the gowks or cuckows, as at the season they are in the greatest plenty; this bird gets hoarse, or seems, by its voice, to have a clocher or spittle in its throat, ready to void; but the truth is, this matter is the production of some insect, and perhaps for the purpose already spoken</p>

            <p>GOWPEN. The cavity two hands can make when their</p>

            <p>sides are laid together; or the quantity of any thing that cavity can hold, the double of a "neifu”.”</p>

            <p>GOWSTED.-Boasted.</p>

            <p>For thou canna do, but a wiffie ava.</p>

            <p>GRANNIE MOIL.-A very old, flattering, false woman. GRASSMEAL.-The grass that will keep a cow for a season. GRASSNAIL.-A long piece of hooked iron, which has one end fixed to the blade of a scythe, and the other to the scythe's handle; so, that (as mowers say), "her runt may sleep steady i'the den."</p>

            <p>GRAULSE. A young salmon.</p>

            <p>GRAY BEARDIE.-A bottle of the larger class, made of earthenware; it is made to hold generally about three gallons, but whiles they have double lugs, and hold a much larger quantity; the whusky pig, in farm houses, is a pig of this kind: "hae ye ought i'the pig the day," is a common salutation, when friendly neighbours meet at others houses; and although whisky be not mentioned, it is well understood to be the thing wanted; answers to salute are <pb n="241" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA241#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />various, such as, "I dare say there is a dreeping,"-"Ay, I heard the gude wife say it could pinkle pankle," &amp;c. GRAY-HEADS.-Heads of grey-coloured oats, growing others that are not.</p>

            <p>among</p>

            <p>GRAY STANES.-Here and there, over all the face of the country, round gray stones make their appearance; there are two things which strike us strongly on looking at this scene "what brought them there," and "what made them of a globular form," that cause which brought them to their present situations; also, has been the cause of rounding them; it is evident from these stanes alone, that some awful revolution has taken place at some distant period, on the earth, and this revolution has been a tremendous flood of water.</p>

            <p>GREDDON.-The remains of fuel, the sweeping out of the peatclaig; the same with coom, almost, only the first brings the idea, that stones and earth are among the remains, the second not.</p>

            <p>GREEN LINTY-The green linnet. This is a beautiful bird easily tamed, but it can sing none.</p>

            <p>GREESHOCHS.-Fires of embers; a greeshoch is much the same with gleed and gloss.</p>

            <p>GRIER O' LAGG.-Grierson, laird of Lagg, in the parish of Dunscore I believe, anciently, the infamous persecutor of the stern and worthy covenantors, the accomplice of the base Claverhouse, and one of the most infernal villains Scotland ever gave birth to; not a church-yard do we go into throughout all the land of Galloway, but we meet with stones, perhaps cleared of their fog by Auld Mortality, testimonies to the inhuman fact; there we think we hear the poor martyrs speaking from their graves, and informing us how they were butchered by the bloody Grier o' Lagg; the heart melts with the detail of their fate, and we feel ready to revenge the cause, were that <pb n="242" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />not done for us already; even on our wild moors, and in our dark glens, we trace the fell tract of the savage. The tower yet remains in a partly ruined state, where he lived when at home, it is a small square keep full of loopholes; when the venerable old man, John Bell, of Whiteside, begged of Grierson a little while to pray, before he was shot, the murderer replied "What, devil, have ye been doing, have ye not prayed enough these many years in the hills ?" was there ever a colder, and more unholy expression? poor John was slain in the parish of Tongueland, February, 1685. "Robert Grierson, of Lagghall, was a persecutor for upwards of ten years, and though excommunicated for being an adulterer, and every thing bad, impertinently obstinate he keeped still being Justice of the Peace." When he was dying, tradition says, that he made a wish to have his feet bathed in cold water, but the moment they were immersed, they made it fizz, and boil wi' hellish heat; indeed, to this day, the horrid word hell, is ever coupled with his name; the country people say sometimes, when enforcing a fact, "that they are as sure such and such is the case, as they are of the laird o' Lagg's being in hell," and about the time of his death which happened in 1700, a ship at sea met with a singular sail, a chariot drawn by six horses, and conducted by three drivers, all of the Pandemonium stamp, coming plunging and snoring over the wild waves, attended by black clouds, vomiting forth thunder and lightning. The sailors hailed, were bound, when the answer received was, from Hell to Colinn. This was the vehicle sent to bring Lagg to the land of Demons.</p>

            <p>When his bodily remains were a taking to the kirkyard for burial, the horses employed in that service seemed to be much fatigued, and at a certain place on the road they stuck up altogether, could go no farther, and appeared ready to perish; a gentleman present, sent home for four of the strongest horses in his stud, yoked them in to the <pb n="243" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />dead carr, they drew it, indeed, to the place required, but the poor animals were so forfoughten out with the job, that they could do nothing afterwards while they lived;-so much then, for Grier o' Lagg; those wishing to know more of him, may consult the Cloud of Witnesses, a good book, and those bunches of tales in prose and rhyme, which help to bound out the wallet of every ballard hawker in Scotland.</p>

            <p>GRINNING HARES.-The devilish art of setting gins in holes of dykes, or on walks, to hang hares; this is the meanest way of all poaching, there is no sport with it, being purely for gain, and truly savage.</p>

            <p>GRIST. The texture of yarns; also, a miller's fee for grinding. The phrase," he has got anither grist to his mill now," means, he has got another way of making a livelihood.</p>

            <p>GROOZLE. To breathe uneasily.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>GROUF. To sleep restlessly.</p>

            <p>GRUE. To nauseate.</p>

            <p>GRUESOME.-Frightful, but that kind of fright which brings</p>

            <p>on vomiting.</p>

            <p>GRUFF.-A short, thick, well-dressed man.</p>

            <p>GRULCH.-A fat child.</p>

            <p>GRULL-A stone bruised to dust.</p>

            <p>GRULLION. A mixture of various food; a hotch podge.</p>

            <p>-</p>

            <p>GRUN.-Ground, a farm; also, any thing grinded.</p>

            <p>GRUNS.-Sediment of any liquid matter.</p>

            <p>GRUPPING. A disorder amongst steep; it grips them in</p>

            <p>the neck, as it were, rendering them unfit to turn their head but one way.</p>

            <p>GRUSHIE.-Fat, flabby, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>GUDDLE. To botch with a knife, to cut rudely.</p>

            <p>GUMPING.-A piece cut of the gump, or whole of any thing; when a banwun of reapers are kemping up a lan', the weak of course fall behind the stronger, and when a shift o' riggs takes place, those forward cut through their weak neighbours rigg, behind, duly opposite the place they left their own, so leave a part of that rig uncut, between them and the weak reaper; this piece is called the gumping. Two cronnies, or a lad and lass in love, never cut the gumping on one another, the cause for why, needs no explanation.</p>

            <p>GUNPOWTHER.-A well known combustible matter, properly named gunpowder; an original poem I give here respecting it, which my readers may relisb, as they think proper :</p>

            <p>HABBLE. To hobble, to walk lamely,</p>

            <p>HABBOCRAWS.-A shout the peasants give to frighten the crows of the corn fields, throwing up their bonnets or hats at the same time. A person once fell a sleeping and snoring in a church; the priest, being a dull orator, when the psalm began to be sung, he believed himself amongst the rooks, and started up, roaring with outspread arms, habbocraws, to the astonishment of the holy congregation.</p>

            <p>HACKED. Rough, cracked, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>HACKS.-Rocky, mossy, black wilds.</p>

            <p>HACKS O' ANWOTH.-A very wild moorish place, in that parish of Anwoth.</p>

            <p>HACKSTON. An old Borgue bard, he had a vein for rhyme; some say but a small vein; he once wrote to the king, to know if he would have him be laureate. Subscribing himself poet and private English teacher, parish of Borgue; what a valuable curiosity would this address to royalty be; Oh! for a copy, but alas, I am afraid is is lost for ever. His song of Paul Jones is tolerable, and is not yet forgot by some :</p>

            <p>"She came from Flambro' Head,</p>

            <p>"Was she not, was she not," &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Blair, the queer laird of Senwick, was wont to have same fun with him, when a party of gentleman was with the singular landlord, Hackston, the poet, (who was commonly about the house) was allowed to come amongst the company; then whisky would be given him, a thing he was always very fond of, and so when they had him half drunk, they diverted themselves at the poor poet's expence; once they got a sword, and made the poor wretch believe he was about to be run through with it, but ere this was done they would grease the blade, so that it might transfix him a sleeker manner; it is needless to sketch the auld wight farther.</p>

            <p>HAFFERS.-Sharing half in any thing.</p>

            <p>HAFFLINS. Half-ways.</p>

            <p>HAFFMANOR. Having land in partnership, between two. HAFTED. Animals are said to be hafted, when they live contented on strange pastures, when they have made a haunt.</p>

            <p>HAG.-To hew.</p>

            <pb n="251" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>HAGELOG.-A clog of wood to hew on.</p>

            <p>HAGS.-Rocky, moor ground; the same with Hacks.</p>

            <p>HAG-YARD.—A stack-yard. The phrase " clear the hag," means, clear all out of the way.</p>

            <p>HAINCHING. Throwing, by springing the arm</p>

            <p>haunch.</p>

            <p>HAIVERS.-Foolish chat; idle conversation.</p>

            <p>HAIVERALLS.-Fools, who talk Haivers.</p>

            <p>on the</p>

            <p>HALLANS.-Mid-walls through cottages, composed of cross bars, and overlaid with straw plastered with clay, called cat clay; also, those abutments or batteries, built against weak walls to keep them from falling, are termed hallans. HALLICKET-Fools. Thoughtless, restless beings, who cannot haul; who must be running every where, and talking a great deal on subjects they know nothing about. HALLION. A blackguard.</p>

            <p>HALLOW-EEN.-Hallow-eve, or eve of All Saints. Before the incomparable Burns brought the superstitious observances of this night into ridicule, it was a wonderful one all over Scotland; and even yet, though superstition be laid aside, it is a night much attended to, and full of frolics; thus a large deep tub is filled with water, in which is put a large apple, so the rustics strip off their upper garments, and try to catch it with their teeth; this they find impossible to do, while it swims on the surface, so they dive down with it under the mouth, and when it strikes the bottom, they dart their tusks in, and so triumphantly brings it up.</p>

            <p>A candle, and apple too, are hung both by one string, at one place; to have a bite of this, without burning the face, creates much fun.</p>

            <p>Then songs are sung, and whisky goes round, which are cheering things, and if attended by a fiddle, much <pb n="252" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA252#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />more so. I have been speaking with respect to the way the lower classes now observe it; the higher again meet in large parties together, play cards, feast, drink, dance, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>But I must own there is nothing so poetical now about the matter, as was in the days o' lang syne. "When blueclues, fair water and foul, eating apples at glasses, washing sark-sleeves at rare burns, pulling kailrunts, &amp;c. went forward." I have seen the old plan tried too, but superstition cannot be mimicated,</p>

            <p>HALLYOCH. A term used to express that strange gabbling noise people make, who are talking in a language we do not understand. Thus, a club of Manxmen together, are said to haud an unco gabbie labbie o' a halyoch wi ither.</p>

            <p>HAMMER, BLOCK, and STUDY.-A school game. A fellow lies on all fours, this is the block; one steadies him before, this is the study; a third is made a "hammer" of, and swung by boys, against the block; it is a rude game. HAMPERS.-Large baskets, carried on the backs of asses. HANBARROW.-A spoked barrow, carried by the hands, HANBEAST.-The horse a ploughman directs with the left hand.</p>

            <p>HANCH.-To eat like a swine,</p>

            <p>HANNIE.-Handy.</p>

            <p>droves of cattle, there</p>

            <p>Drovers, in purchasing</p>

            <p>HAN OWRE HEAD.-A phrase, signifying " choosing without selecting;" thus, in large are some fat and others lean. these, will sometimes take the good, and leave the had, this is called shooting; others will take the lot as it is, this is buying them, hand owre head, both plans are ruled by the way the bargain is made, to leave shotts and have all good, the price for each will be larger, of course, than taking them at random.</p>

            <pb n="253" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>HAND-REEL-An old reel or machine, used for winding and numbering the hanks of yarn; while winding, the "There's ane, and there's no</p>

            <p>auld wives counted thus:</p>

            <p>ane, and there's ane a' out."</p>

            <p>HANSLE. A morning lunch.</p>

            <p>HANTLE. A quantity of any thing, and it may either mean</p>

            <p>a large or a small quantity, there being no limitation to the term; "he has a hantle o' yon sillar dune now" means, that a good sum of the money is spent, but how much or how little it does not determine. An English woodcutter was assisting once to hew down a Gallovidian forrest, when a native came up to him and said, "he had a hantle o' that timmer down now." The Englishman stood mute, and the traveller, thinking him sullen, passed on; the other bucherons observing this, gathered round their fellow, and began to quiz him about not answering the man; "I knew (said our hero of the hatchet) well enough what the fellow said, but how could I answer him? If he had told me how many acres of wood he mean'd by a hantle, then I might have been able to give him some satisfaction."</p>

            <p>HAPP.-To Cover; also a cover.</p>

            <p>HAPSHACKLED.-An horse is said to be so when an hind</p>

            <p>and fore foot are confined by a rope fixed to them; this is to hinder them to "hop" or leap.</p>

            <p>HAP, STEP, and JUMP.-A way of taking three leapsfirst hop, then step, and again leap.</p>

            <p>HAP THE BEDS.-A singular game gone through by hopping on one foot, and with that foot sliding a little flat stone out of an oblong bed, rudely drawn on a smooth piece of ground; this bed is divided into eight parts, the two of which at the farther end of it are called the kail pots; if the player then stands at one end, and pitches the smooth stone into all the divisions one after the other, <pb n="254" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />following the same on a foot, (at every throw) and bringing it out of the figure, this player wins not only the game, but is considered a first-rate daub at it; failing, however, to go through all the parts so, without missing either a throw or a hop, yet keeping before the other gamblers (for many play at one bed), still wins the curious rustic game.</p>

            <p>HAP WEEL-RAP WEEL-A phrase, meaning "hit or</p>

            <p>miss."</p>

            <p>HARGLE BARGLIN.-Higgling, disputing about bargainmaking.</p>

            <p>HARL. To trail, a harl a trail.</p>

            <p>HARRIST.-Harvest; sometimes Hairst.</p>

            <p>HARRIST BROTH.-The broth made use of as food in harvest, allowed to be the best broth to be met with in the country all the year round, for then the vegetable world is in perfection; then indeed they sparkle with rich een, and a brose made with the broe taken out of the lee side o' the kail pot, is quite an exquisite dish at this season, setting at nought the boasted skill of the French in the art of cookery.</p>

            <p>HARRIST MOON.-The moon in the harvest or Michaelmas time of the year. At this season she presents us with one of the most vivid marks we have of the Almighty directing the movements of nature toward the good of man; by attending to her motions at this period, can any rational creature deny the existence of Deity? it is impossible. Though we may know by the sublime science of Astronomy</p>

            <p>"That the Harrist Moon,</p>

            <p>"Rises nine nights alike soon," or will rise.</p>

            <p>That as she is passing through one of her northern nodes, or ascending, while the sun is southing beyond the Equator, and descending, her march round the earth becomes as it <pb n="255" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />were obvious on the horizon; every night for about nine together, we find her having her thirteen degrees of more amplitude from the south, which are about her daily number, and so waning away to the north. Yet who gave her orders for this? who caused her wanderings to be this way at this season, and at no other? Who but he whom all should adore, in the fulness of soul.</p>

            <p>By fixing her this way, how is the husbandman befriended, and when this is so, is not all mankind befriended? for the farmer feeds the world. Was the moon not to shine forth in harvest-time, was darkness to come on the moment the sun sank in the west, how much would it retard the gathering in the fruits of the earth; but as it is otherways, the farmer has the liberty of adding whatever part of the night he pleases to the day, in order to forward his labours, and assist him in wunning up the year's wark. Anciently though, this moon, which was called the Michaelmas moon, was hailed by some of our ancestree as a mighty useful thing for other purposes-viz. in reaving and making inroads, many a marauder made a good fortune in her beams. The tocher which a doughty borderer gave a daughter, was the result of his reaving during this moon. But surely Providence never intended her to favour such as the Elliots, the Armstrongs, and Jocks o' the Side of yore.</p>

            <p>HARTSCAUD.-The heart-burn.</p>

            <p>HASH.-An impudent young man.</p>

            <p>HASHLOCH.-Waste, refuse, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>HASKY.-Husky, rough, &amp;c. not clean nor smooth.</p>

            <p>HASPLE. A sloven in every sense of the word.</p>

            <p>HATTIE. A game with preens, pins, on the crown of a</p>

            <p>-</p>

            <p>hat; two or more may play; each lay on a pin, then with the hand they strike the side of the hat, time about, and whoever makes the pins by a stroke cross each other, lift <pb n="256" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA256#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />those so crossed. It is quite delightful to describe the Scotch games. Navigators sail away by the pole, and travellers pop their noses into Africa, yet bring not home accounts of the manners of any people half so strange as our own, when truly described.</p>

            <p>HAUGHS.-Wide glens, with some level land in them, and a river running down the middle. Haughs, cleuchs, glens, and gills, are all of the same "genera," as a naturalist would say, but different in species and character. HAURK.-A term much used by Scotch foxhunters, when the hounds find the scent of reynard in one of his keeps, or challenge him; the terriers or little dogs are brought to the place, and desired by Nimrod to get below, far aneath the yird, the which they will do without much entreaty; but when they come near the throne of his majesty, his highness places himself so in a jamb or chink, that they cannot get behind him; there stand the little vicious creatures, and keep up a continued barking. When the hunter hears by them the situation they are in, he bawls down to</p>

            <p>haurk to him, haurk to him, ye wee blasties; so, in defiance of the tusks of the fox, they seize on, and drag out the crafty villain.</p>

            <p>HAURL-A female careless of dress.</p>

            <p>HAURNPAN.-The scull.</p>

            <p>HAURRAGE.-A blackguard crew of people.</p>

            <p>HAVERON. A goat a year old, gelded.</p>

            <p>HAVOC-BURDS.-Those large flocks of small birds which fly about the fields after harvest; they are of different sorts, though all of the linnet tribe. Whunlinties form the greatest number.</p>

            <p>HAWCKIN. The noise made to clear the throat. HAWKIE.-An affectionate name for a favorite cow. Burns talks about "twall-pint Hawkie," Hurly Hawkie is the call milk-maids use to call the cows home to be milked.</p>

            <pb n="257" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>It is somewhat a curious song, that one of Hurlie</p>

            <p>Hawkie; the world may have a sight of it :-</p>

            <p>O yonder's my Nannie gathering the kye,</p>

            <p>Whar the e'ening sun is beaming,</p>

            <p>Awa on the hazley brae down by,</p>

            <p>Whar the yellow nits are leaming.</p>

            <p>And ay she cries " Hurly Hawkie,</p>

            <p>"String awa my crommies, to the milking loan.</p>

            <p>"Hurly, Hurly, Hawky."</p>

            <p>How sweetly her voice dinnles through my heart,</p>

            <p>I'll wyle roun, and her forgather,</p>

            <p>Tak a kiss or twa, and than gae part,</p>

            <p>For fear o' her crusty father.</p>

            <p>And ay she cries, "Hurly Hawkie,</p>

            <p>"String, string awa hame to the milking loan,</p>

            <p>"Hurly, Hurly, Hawky."</p>

            <p>Now a' in a flutter she lies in my arms,</p>

            <p>On the hinny smelling bank o' clover,</p>

            <p>Wha wad be sae base as steal her charms,</p>

            <p>It shall na be me her lover.</p>

            <p>I'll let her cry, "Hurly Hawkie,</p>

            <p>"And wize the kye hame to the milking loan,</p>

            <p>"Hurly, Hurly, Hawky.".</p>

            <p>HAWK-STUDYIN.-The way hawks steadily hover above their prey before they pounce on it; they anchor themselves in the air, as it were, and always with their "bow" or breast to the wind. No other birds but them seem to be able to "bring to" in the ærial element; no wonder this was taken notice of by the ancients, as in the question put to the Man of Uzz, "Dost thou know how the hawk flies ?" Indeed, none can say how; none human.</p>

            <p>HAWSE-BANE.-That rise beneath the chin on the throat. HRADIM AND CORSIM.-A game with pins. Pins are hid with fingers in the palms of the hands; the same number is laid alongside them, and either headim or corsim called out by those who do so; when the fingers are lifted, if the heads of the pins hid, and those beside them, be lying one way, when the crier cried headim, then that player wins; but if corsim, the one who hid the pins wins. This is the king of all the games at the preens, and let it not be thought that it is a bairn's play; by no means; <pb n="258" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />it is played by lads and lasses as big as ever they will be, and by those whom age has again made young; the game is simple and harmless, and not uninteresting; the Peasant is as anxious about gaining a preen, as my Lord Duke would be ten thousand pounds; when the stakes run high, barnmen and ploughmen get noisy over them, and play open-mouthed, taking such hearty laughs whiles, that sparrows who have "taken up lodging for the night," in the thacked easings, flutter frightened from their holes. Cheatery is sometimes heard of in this game too; then is the saying sounded, "They wha begin to steal needles and pins, end wi' stealing horned kye;" (as the twig is bent the tree's inclined.)</p>

            <p>HEADRIGG. The ridge which runs along the ends of the others.</p>

            <p>HEADS AND TAILS.-That plan for deciding matters by</p>

            <p>the "birl o' a bawbee." The one side cries heads, (when the piece is a whirling in the air) and the other tails; so whichever is up when the piece alights, that gains, or settles the matter; heads standing for the king's head, tails for she who represents Britannia. Some will doubtless laugh at me for explaining things minutely which seem to them to be so well known as to need no explanation; I may just laugh at these in return, for there is not one in a hundred "could explain" what is-heads and tails.</p>

            <p>HEATHER-BLEET.-The mire-snipe.</p>

            <lg type="verse">
                <l>"The laverock and the lark,</l>
                <l>"The bawckie and the bat,</l>
                <l>“The heatherbleet, the mire-snipe,</l>
                <l>"How many burds be that?"</l>
            </lg>

            <p>There are some who must think awhile before they answer this question rightly, by saying three. The snipe is called heather-bleet, from her loving wild heathery marshes, and when soaring aloft," bleating" with her wings, in the spring time. Yes, bleating with her wings, not <pb n="259" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA259#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />with her mouth; she vibrates her wings quick against the air, causing the sweet bleating noise to take place.</p>

            <p>HEATHER-Cow-A heath-broom.</p>

            <p>BATHER</p>

            <p>HECH!-An exclamation used almost on every emergency.</p>

            <p>HECH-HOW! The same as the above; only it is the name of the poisonous herb, hemlock, also.</p>

            <p>HECH-HOW-HUM!-An exclamation much like those above, only, it is always accompanied with a yawn.</p>

            <p>HECK-A hay-rack. Also the toothed thing which guides the spun-thread on to the pirn, in spinning-wheels. HEDDLES-Those parts of a weaver's loom through which the threads come to be wove. They are connected with the " threadles," and can be altered any way at the weaver's pleasure, by his touching the "treadles" with his feet.</p>

            <p>HEEZIE-A mighty lift.</p>

            <p>HELL'S-HOLES-Those dark nooks which are dreaded as being haunted with bogles.</p>

            <p>HELTER-SKELTER-Bounding forward, fearless of every thing; not caring whether the way is right or wrong, confused or not.</p>

            <p>HEMP-RIGGS-Ridges of fat land whereon hemp was sown in the olden time; and in these modern days, when land is a praising for goodness, it is said to be as strong as hemp-riggs.</p>

            <p>HENCHVENTS-The same with " gores," pieces of linen put into the lower parts of a shirt, to make that end wider than the other, to give "vent" or room for the "haunch." HERON, the Historian.-Sketches of the life and character of this ill-fated Gallovidian, have now frequently been given, so I only mean to say a few things not spoken of by any. When he was in his seventeenth or eighteenth <pb n="260" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />year, he taught some farmers families in the Parish o' Borgue. My mother had the honour to be one of his pupils. He lashed his scholars sometimes dreadfully, for his temper was easily ruffled. A big lad at his school being called up for punishment once, the fellow burst out "that he would not be lashed by any Heron that ever lap on twa legs;" so the teacher and he had a set-to, both came madly to the scratch, the dominie was floored, his breadbasket was almost broke on a bink, and from his nose claret leaked profusely.</p>

            <p>In those days he was a great reader: the book was never out of his hand, and the manner in which he punished the boys was hitting them a skelp on the side of the head with a book, which made the tears start in their eyes. He frequented the loop of a burn much: this was an out-of-theway nuik. Here did he study with deep attention the mazy world of literature. When the house-maid would have wanted him to come to dinner, in vain might she have stood at a distance and called on Mr. Heron; he heard her not, being so deeply absorbed with his books, so she had no other shift than always go, and put at him with her hand, saying whiles, " O! wad the burn rise some day and swoop Heron afore't into the sea". These natural touches, trivial looking though they be, strike at the foundation of this wayward character. He was fretful and ambitious, fond to excess of learning; had he read nature though, more than books, it would have been as well for his fame now a-days. He is not an original writer; his thoughts commonly are at second or third hand. Had he given the world a history of his native clauchan, New Galloway, I do not know but it would have been as much to his fame as his History of Scotland, good though that work be. His sentences are much too long, a reader is apt to lose the thread of the discourse. Poor fellow ! but why say any thing against him? few, few are born with <pb n="261" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />half his talents. The heart melts when thinking of his latter end; had I been in London when he was inhumanly incarcerated in a lazar-house, if I had not found some means to relieve, I would have perished with him.</p>

            <p>HET-AHAME-It is said of those who wander abroad when they have no need to do so, and happen to fare ill, that they "war owre het ahame.”</p>

            <p>HET-BITCH-A bitch in her rutting season.</p>

            <p>HET-DRINKS-Warm drinks of the cordial nature, which gude-wives bumper at "Kimmerins.”</p>

            <p>HEUGHS-Precipices. Some of these in Galloway are very steep and deep; perhaps those of Cruggleton and Rascarrel are the largest on the shore, but those of Cairnsmoor, in the inland, are far larger. Many kill themselves clambering about on these for birds' eggs and "pasper," and cattle often fall over, them no more to rise with the life. Davie Maben, an old cross-grained Herd, once quarrelled with his dog, when he catched him by the hind heels, and tossed him over the "Raen Nest Heuch" of the "Netherlaw," exclaiming, when the poor tyke was suffering below, "Did you not know that I was a passionate man?" Perhaps Shakespear or Scott have expressed nothing more genuine than this, of mad feeling.</p>

            <p>HEY WULLIE WINE, and How WULLIE WINE-An old fire-side play of the peasantry, hinted at by Cromek; but there are many ways of drawing out the merry concern. Suppose, seated round the ingle, in the fore-night, a large party of lads and lasses, full of mirth, beauty, honesty, and simplicity; in short, bairnies of nature. One of the lasses, for instance, addresses one of the lads so</p>

            <p>"Hey, Wullie Wine, and How Wullie Wine,</p>

            <p>"I hope for hame ye'll no incline,</p>

            <p>Such is a specimen of the concern. The lad, before the questions are put, whispers to another, the girl he will stop with-so this one must be given, before the dialogue ends. The chief drift of this singular amusement seems to be, to discover the sweethearts of one another, and such discoveries are thought valuable, but not so much so as they were anciently.</p>

            <p>HIDDLINS-In a hidden way, not open.</p>

            <p>HIE-COCKET HAT-A hat with the brim thrice cocked. It is said to be "the life of an old hat to cock it." Anciently these hats were very commonly wore; also hair tied and clubed in a ribbon fang; coats long in the waist with large buttons; waistcoats with pouch-flaps side on the thee, and mostly of a demity cut, with broad mother o' pearl búttons; breeches without braces, but with buckles and buckle-flaps, and these breeks were generally of either a hoddan grey or slate-blue colour; stockings knitted ahame, with many ribs; shoes sharp-toed, with buckles, and often with buckles and fause-tags. Thus adorned, tag-rag and bob-tail, our forefathers were no joke. A dandy at a country kirk in these times would have been hailed as a most astonishing object; the auld wives would have thought" it had drapped frae the moon." The first umbrella that ever was braced in Galloway belonged to a Sutor, who won'd about the Gate-house fifty years ago; he ran allwheres through the country to display the farly, and being at Borgue kirk one windy day, while coming over the kirk-stile, all eyes on him, a gurl came, when all sail was set, and away went the tappin lift, down came the pikes clashing about his lugs, and one of them transfixed his cheek to the effusion of Crispan's blood. O! but I glory to keek back into the days of yore, and take a laugh. HIELAN FLING-A rustic dance.</p>

            <p>HIELAN-MAN'S BURIAL-A funeral which lasts more than</p>

            <p>a day. These are common yet in the Highlands of Scotland, but rarely now to be met with in the Lowlands; however, funerals nigh approaching to them sometimes happen. The mourners get "fow" at the burial house, and have a dancing time with the corpse on the road from thence to the kirk-yard. If the old "freet" be true "that those who fall when at the handspake aneath the <pb n="264" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA264#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />corpse, will soon be the corpse themsell," there would soon be a good few corpses; for at these "druken" concerns, the bearers are falling some of them every now and then. The following is a verbatim account of one of these burials:-"At length the laird o' the Bowertree Buss, gaed his last pawt, was straughted, dressed, coffined and a'; and I was bidden to his burial the Tuesday after."</p>

            <p>"There I gaed, and there were met a wheen fine boys. Tam o' the Todholes, and Wull o' the Slack war there; Neil Wulson, the fisher, and Wull Rain, the gunner, too; the first service that came roun' was strong farintosh, famous peat reek, there was nae grief amang us. The laird had plenty, had neither a wife nor a wean, sae wha cud greet. We drew close to ither, and began the cracks ding dang, while every minute roun' came anither reamin service. I faun' the bees i' my head bizzin strong, in a wee time. The inside of the burial house was like the inside o' a Kelton-hill tent; a banter came frae the tae side of the room, and was sent back wi' a jibe frae the ither. Lifting at last began to be talked about, and at last lift we did. 'Whaever wished for a pouchfu' o' drink might tak it.' This was the order; sae mony a douce black coat hang side wi' a heavy bottle. On we gaed wi' the laird, his weight we faun na'. Wull Weer we left ahin drunk on the spot. Rob Fisher took a sheer as we came down the green brae, and landed himsell in a rossen o' breers: Whaup-nebbed Samuel fell aff the drift too. saw him as we came cross Howmcraig; the drink was gaen frae him like couters. Whan we came to the Taffdyke that rins cross Barrend, there we laid the laird down till we took a rest a wee. The inside o' pouches war than turned out, bottle after bottle was touted owre; we rowed about, and some warsled. At last a game at the quoits was pro</p>

We got it to fit at last, and in wi' the mools on't. The grave-digger we made a beast o'. Sic a funeral I was ne'er at afore; surely, I ay think that it was na unlike a Hielan'-man's Burial.”</p>

            <p>HILLANS-Small artificial hills of any thing.</p>

            <p>HILL-FOWK-Those truly religious and independent people, the Covenanters, well known to all the world ages ago, and the inhuman manner in which they were persecuted anciently, makes all men of feeling admire them. That person is never of a great character who laughs at the hillfowk; there is less patriotic blood in the veins of such than would fill a nut-shell, and the heart is as rotten as a yellow puddock stool. They are called the hill-fowk, from their love of the primitive plan of worshipping the Creator, as his son did, amongst the hills and mountains in the open air, under the cerulean canopy. Of all the sects of Christians in the world, these and the Quakers for me; because the last say little, and wrangle less, respecting religious matters, but venerate the whole with solemn and silent awe, moving, about on this sinful planet, an honor to the human race; and the first for why, they do speak but in a natural and manly manner. I have felt myself frequently very much refreshed with hearing a hill-preaching, and once was foolish enough to scrawl a little pam<pb n="269" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />phlet respecting hill-preachers, which was published in Galloway, intitled Osborn and Syminton on the Weighbeam. The Hill-fowk are the fowk to whom the kirk of Scotland owes all her beauty; for this they paid dearly with their blood at Drumclog, Bothwell Brigg, and elsewhere-scenes never to be forgotten.</p>

            <p>HILT NOR HAIR-When any thing is lost, and cannot be found, we say, that we canna see hilt nor hair o't," not the slightest vestige. To English the phrase closely, we may say, "Top nor tail."</p>

            <p>HINGING-LUGGED-A person is said to be hinginglugged when having an ill-will at any one, and apparently sulky. "Such a one has a hinging-lugg at me," means that that one is not well disposed towards me. For my own part, I am in love with all mankind; I never had a very great outcast with any, and at present have not a hinging lugg at a living soul. The kicks and thousand rebuffs of this world, thank God, I can take with pleasure, and give none. This phrase comes from the way dogs, and some other brutes, have, of letting their ears-luggs, droop when on the eve of battle.</p>

Some argue that the best players should not play last, as then the rink is made so foul with stones they have no chance to do any thing. However, the nature of man is always for having something good to rest his hopes on at the last; so good players must always finish the splore.</p>

            <p>HINNIE-PIGS-A school game; also pots to hold honey. The boys who try this sport sit down in rows, hands locked beneath their hams. Round comes one of them, the honey-merchant, who feels those who are sweet or sour, by lifting them by the arm-pits, and giving them three shakes; if they stand these without the hands unlocking below, they are then sweet and saleable, fit for being officebearers of other ploys. As to the pigs, real honey-pots, an old bee-man once had a very bad boy for a son, who longed to get at his father's hinnie-pigs, which were kept secure in a strong chest. Long the boy attempted to get a lick of the treasure, but in vain. At last he hit on the infernal plan of loading the lid of the bunker so with stones, that it gave way, and smashed the bale o' the hinnie-pigs. His father, hearing the crash, hunted him through the clauchan, bawling out, "I never saw the like o' him, ye never saw the like o' him, nor mortal man ever saw the like o' him."</p>

            <p>HINTINGS The furrows which ploughmen finish their ridges with. These furrows are not like the others; they are lifted out of the bottom of the main "furr," and are soil of a different nature.</p>

            <p>The greatest difficulty young ploughmen have to surmount when learning the tilth trade, is the proper way to "lift hintins." This is the key-stone of the business, and ploughing-matches are always decided by the way in which this is done. I may here add, that it is never those who gain prizes at the art of Cain who are the most useful ploughmen to the farmer; they are too conceited, always running to the forge with their airns, and still flattering and fattening their horses; a common hand is always worth any two of these.</p>

            <p>HIPLOCHS-The coarse wool which grows about the hips of sheep.</p>

            <pb n="271" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA271#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>HIRPLE-TO walk in a lame-like manner.</p>

            <p>HIRR-The call to a dog to make him hunt.</p>

            <p>HIRSLE-A flock of animals; also, to slide softly on our bottom.</p>

            <p>HITCH-A noose, a knot, a turn of a rope round any thing. HIVING-SOUGH-A singular sound bees are heard to make before they hive or cast, or leave their parents. Only Beefowk who understand the nature of the insect well, know any thing about this sough or sound. It is commonly heard the evening before their departure. The bee's bonello probably it may be. It is a continued buzzing hum, full of melancholy-like cadences. While on bees, I may note a few of the many curiosities respecting them, unspoke of by Virgil in his Georgics; Bonar, or any one else. When a swarm intends to have a long flight, they gather close together into the space of a few yards square, or, as the peasantry say, into the breath o' a gude grey plaid. When they assume this figure, it is vanity to follow them. This is the method they take of easing their flight, a plan Poet Milton discovered, respecting wild-geese, and other migrating birds. And what is singular, bees, in this state, always wing their way right against the wind; now, know they where they intend to journey to before they start, or fly they at random? If they know the place, then they must look out for a fair wind, though with us that is a head one, in present maritime law; but methinks, at these times they know not where they wander, as frequently they alight on a spot open to the elements, and so perish, whereas they might have easily found a snug place. Bees, taken to the torrid zone, do well the first year, but learning there is no winter, but summer for ever, they soon turn lazy, as when brought from the Moorlands to the Dale. Some fancy we may take the honey from them without killing, but this cannot be done. Let Bonar reason as he will. Mine original Mossie Cloon would once turn a Bee<pb n="272" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA272#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />man, so followed one through the country awhile, to learn the trade of taking and leaving a part. At last he thought himself fit for the trick, so a friend would let him try; a crowd gathered round, and Mossie began operations. The bees became crusty; out they rushed in legions, vowing revenge.

            <p>HOCH-BAN'-A band which confines one of the legs of a restless animal; it passes round the neck and one of the legs.</p>

            <p>HOCHLE-To tumble lewdly with women in open day.</p>

            <p>HODDAN-To have a kind of jog when either walking or riding.</p>

            <p>HOG-MA-NAY, or HUG-ME-NAY-The last day of the year. Dr. Jamieson, with a research that would have frightened even a Murray or a Scalinger to engage in, has at last owned, like a worthy honest man as he is, that the origin of this term is quite uncertain; and so should I say also, did I not like to be throwing out a hint now and then on various things, even suppose I be laughed at for doing so.</p>

            <p>Then here I give, like myself, who am a being of small scholarcraft, a few hindish speculations respecting this mystic phrase; to be plain, I think hog-ma-nay means hug-me-now-Hawse and ney, the old nurse term, meaning, "kiss me, and I'm pleased," runs somewhat near it: ney or nay, may be a variation that time has made on now. Kissing, long ago, was a thing much more common than at present. People, in the days gone by, saluted other in churches, according to Scripture, with holy kisses; and this smacking system was only laid aside when priests began to see that it was not holiness alone prompted their congregations to hold up their gabs to one another like Amous dishes, as Burns says. And in "ane compendious buik o' Godly and Spiritual Sangs, for the avoiding of Sinne and Harlotree," printed in the old black letter, by Andro Hart, at Edinburgh, in 1590, the song of " John, come kiss me now," made its appearance as a suitable one to be sung in the kirk</p>

            <p>At weddings too, what a kissing there was; and even to this day, at these occasions much of it goes on and on the happy nights of hog-ma-nay, the kissing trade is extremely brisk, particularly in Auld Reekie; then the lasses must kiss with all the stranger lads they meet, while phrases not unlike to—</p>

            <p>or</p>

            <p>"John, come kiss me now,</p>

            <p>"John, come hug me now,"</p>

            <p>are frequently heard. From such causes, methinks, hogma-nay has started. The hugging day, the time to hug</p>

            <p>me-now.</p>

            <p>HOG-SCORES-Distance-lines in the game of curling. They are made in the form of a wave, and are placed one-fifth part of the whole rink from either wilter; that is to say, if the rink be fifty yards long, from tee to tee, the hog-scores of that rink are thirty yards distant from other.</p>

            <p>If the bottom of a stone gets over this "score," and its upper bulb not, still that stone is no " hogg." If the stones come not over this line, they are flung out of the game. Sweeping is not allowed until the stone comes over the hogg, unless by the person who played it.</p>

            <p>HOLIN WI' HUNGER-Those a-gnawing with hunger, are said to be "holing wi' hunger," or that the worms are eating up their empty " ingangs," and holing their</p>

            <p>bodies.</p>

            <p>HOOCH-A shout of joy. "Hooch, its a' like a wadding,"</p>

            <p>shout the peasantry, when dancing, making their heels crack on other at same time. Hooch is sure to inspire glee while tribbling Bob Major, or cutting double quick time. This call is considered extremely vulgar by the <pb n="275" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />genteel, but what the devil cares the honest rustic about the genteel. One of his terms, warm from the heart of nature, is worth a million of artful gentilities; it carries a strong sough always.</p>

            <p>HOODICRAWS-Carrion, or grey-crows, called hoodicraws, for when they get old, they become white in colour all but the feathers of the head; these keep black, and look as if the bird had on a cowl or hud. About wild sea-shores, these fowls mark the outgoing of the tide, so to get at the shell-fish called wilk, or periwinkle, a kind of sea-snail, cased in a strong castle, but not impregnable to the hoodicraw; he lifts them into the air thirty or forty yards, then entrusts them to the care of gravity, which brings them crashing down on the rocks, followed close by the voracious bird, who picks up the uncastled gentry as dainty food for the gizzeron.</p>

            <p>The whut-throat or weazle, and the hoodie, have often bloody wars with other about a piece of food they both relish, such as the egg of a hen. Once, Squire Weazle seemed rather too many for his hudded lordship, who flew up into the air, thinking to get rid in that element of his vicious opponent; but no, the weazle would keep his hold, fly as he would, and as high as he pleased. At length, when they had almost got above the clouds, poor hoodie was beheld coming owre the body and owre the body to the earth; and, on going up to where they fell, there was the crow lying with spread wings, quite dead, the weazle, with its sharp teeth, having nicked the wizen, and pumped the blood from his heart.</p>

            <p>HOOLOCH, or HURLOCH-A hurl of stones, an avalanche. Boys go to the heughs whiles to tumble down hoolochs, receiving much pleasure from seeing them roll and clanter down the steeps. It is dangerous sport though, for some<pb n="276" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />times they miss the balance, and make part of the hooloch themselves.</p>

            <p>HOSHENS-Hose without feet.</p>

            <p>HOTTER-A person over-run with vermin, who hotches. HOTTER-BONNET-A person much the same as above. HOTTLE-Any thing which has not a firm base of itself, such as a young child, when beginning to walk; the same with tottle.</p>

            <p>HOWDER-TO hide; also a game at scull-duddery.</p>

            <p>HOWDIE-A midwife. Midwives shine respectable in history from the days of Moses downward to the present day. Anciently in Scotland, the superstitious made some observes respecting them</p>

            <p>"For, Wattie's mare stood still, and swat wi' fright,</p>

            <p>"Whan she brought east the 'howdie' un'ernight,"</p>

            <p>says Allan Ramsey.</p>

            <p>Howк-To dig.</p>

            <p>Howм-Flat pieces of land by a river or burn-side.</p>

            <p>How's a'?—A common salutation.</p>

            <p>66</p>

            <p>HOWSPEAKING- - Speaking like ventriloquists, from the belly, as it were. Burns has Death speaking this way. He spak right how my name is Death," &amp;c. Country folks say of those who speak this way, "that they speak as if the soun' cam out o' a hogyet.”</p>

            <p>HOWTS-Huts. The word which sometimes prefaces one thing, sometimes another; such as, howts-nonsense; howts-ay; and so howts means a something between yes no, which is not easy to express.</p>

            <p>and</p>

            <p>HOW-WECHTS-Circular implements, of sheep-skin stretched on a hoop, used about barns and mills to lift grain and such things with. See Wechts.</p>

            <p>HUAM. The moan of the owl in the warm days of sum it retires to the darkest recesses of woods, and continues repeating, with a moaning air, "huam." I had some work before I found the sound proceeded from the owl; the people about me said, as their ancestors had no doubt done, that the sound "was the humming o' boggles i'the dark green wud."

            <p>HULE.-Some will have hule to be a demon of some kind or other, but I am inclined to think that "hule" is little else but another way of mouthing hell. "He's a terrible hule." "He's a hule's boy," and "saw ye the hule?" these phrases, for instance, may all be explained by using hell instead of hule. Hule therefore, does not express any kind of creature, unless that creature be a moving hell, of itself.</p>

            <p>HUM-DRUM.-A person of careless habits; one who pays attention to nothing under the sun; who has no business, and no hobbies, and who keeps the intellects in a "straitjacket."</p>

            <p>a hurlubrelu, as the French call it; and the Hottentots, hurrocks; a murmuring noise, as the sea surge on a peebly shore.

                <p><hw>INJINE</hw>—Genius. We say of any with a dungeon of a head, that that person is a "great injine." Burns has the Bauld Lapraik o' Muirkirk, an injine, because he was a deacon at song making; and I hold his son Geordy Lapraik, in London, a worthy man, if not an injine; he is quite a chip of the old black, whereas the eldest son of Burns, I am sorry to say is, — no, I will not say what. Our Scotch songs are all immense flights of genius, all composed by persons having injine; they are mostly of a melancholy nature, and this lives much longer than mirth; indeed, a tinge of melancholy gilds every thing that lives long. The Duncan Grey, and Tam Glen, of Burns, are just humourous touches of melancholy, the same as Shakspeare's comedies are; this melancholy then, is the foundation of a poet's genius, this is his injine. "But why seek to know, (as the Swiss philosopher says), what is genius? if thou hast it, thy feelings will tell what it is; if thou hast it not, thou never canst know it. If thou art calm <pb n="280" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA280#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />and tranquil, amid the works of nature, and transports of music; if thou feelest no delirium, no extacy; if thou art only moved with pleasure, at what should transport thee with rapture; dost thou dare to ask what genius is? profane not, vulgar man, that name sublime, what imports thee to know what thou canst never feel.". Russeau-sur le mot genie, on the word genius. O! that I knew what it was. O! that I had injine; but alas poor me!</p>

                <p><hw>INKS</hw>. On muddy, level shores, there are pieces of land overflowed with high spring tides, and not touched by common ones, according to the laws of nature; on these grow a coarse kind of grass, good for sheep threatened with the rot; this saline food sometimes cures them. When there comes a roaring spring tide before a storm, its whirling motion washes out circular holes in the sludge; these are left filled with water, which soon stagnates, and becomes of an inky colour, but I do not think that it is from ink the word inks arises, for all that; such land is called links, in various districts of Scotland, and I am inclined to fancy the word derives its origin from some ancient tongue.</p>

The same worthy once made a remark that I could never forget; he said, that the old Scottish proverb, "what's gude to gie is gude to keep," was not only true; but "what was gien was sometimes not worth the taking,”though thought otherways by the giver; this was "casting an auld coat to a puir body, but afore doing sae, to set to, and cut the buttons out o't," which rendered the present indeed, not worth the taking.</p>

            <p>JOCKIE FAW, the GIPSIE LADDIE.-A celebrated gypsie who flourished about two hundred years ago, in the south of Scotland. Mention is made of him in various traditions; and in the old song of the Annandale Thieves, honorable notice is taken. However, he himself is immortalized in an ancient ballad, in which he is the hero; which informs us of his enticing away the lady of Lord Cassle in Ayrshire; the tale says he gave her a certain kind of ginger, which cuist such a glaumry over her, that she followed the gypsie through thick and thin; whether this ginger was the dodgell reepan already spoken of, is not known, but it had had a similar effect to it. I have heard of an herb of the daffie-down-dilly stamp, which, if got into a lady's shoe, that lady will follow the herbalist every where; and that on its being put so once, when the lady had to take off her shoes for the purpose of wading a river, she changed her notion in the middle of the stream, returned to the bank, extremely vexed with herself that she had been so foolish, but the moment she put on her shoes again, the tid took her, and made her wade and return, and wade again, until she was quite exhausted. But to my subject-Many editions of the song of the Gypsie Laddie have now been given the world, but was ever this one of mine given? Never-And I believe it to be as genuine as any that have ever appeared:</p>

            <p>The gypsies they came to Lord Cassle's yet,</p>

            <p>And o but they sang ready,</p>

            <p>They sang sae sweet and sae complete,</p>

            <p>That down came the lord's fair lady.</p>

            <p>O she came tripping down the stair,</p>

            <p>Wi' a' her maids afore her,</p>

            <p>And as soon as they saw her weelfared face,</p>

            <p>They cuist their glaumry owre her.</p>

            <p>She gaed to them the gude white bread,</p>

            <p>And they gaed to her the ginger,</p>

            <p>JOCK MULLDROCH.-A fellow who lived at Craigwaggie, Galloway, once, perhaps about 150 years ago. Tradition says that he laid eggs, ay eggs, larger than goose eggs, and strangely spreckled black and yellow; he used to cackle too after he laid them, which was on a truff laft amang a wheen breckans; sometimes he was called Craigwaggie's meikle chuckie; once a fortnight he is said to have produced an egg, and his mother, after having sold a few of them as bonny goose eggs, she set a couple of them beneath a braw tappend hen to clock. Long and dreich did the favourite chucky of Lucky Mulldroch sit on them before they were hatched; at length they chipped, and out came two little <pb n="287" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />lads clad in green, and under the gudewife's care they thrace, and were well known long over the south of Scotland by the title of the Birlies. Willie and Wattie Birly were well liked by every body; they were something in the nature of brownies, or rather mangrell fairies. They vanished away though, and after the year forty, the year of the lang storm, they never were heard of; some think they sank in a snaw wride, and afterwards into a Qua-See Quaking Qua.</p>

            <p>JORGLE.-The noise of broken bones.</p>

            <p>JOTTRELL.-Any thing about to fall in pieces.</p>

            <p>JOUK. To avoid a blow by an active turn; also to conceal on a sudden.</p>

            <p>Jow.-A driving sound as it were; a swing attended with a</p>

            <p>sound; it is hard to express the full meaning of jow. After the sad battle for Scotland of Flodden Field, when the "flowers of the forest war a wed away," fought 9th September, 1513, on the news coming to Edinburgh next day of the disaster, the magistrates gave out a proclamation, that the inhabitants were to get ready their "fensabill geir and wapponis for weir," and appear before them at the jowing of the common Tolbooth-bell. This is about the first time jowing appears in print. Burns has the bells in his Holy Fair "began to jow and croon," swing and sound. Jow and show, I dare say, are twins; and show and shove are one. Shuggie show, a " shaking shove."— We say of the sea, whiles in a stormy day, that the jaws of it are coming jowing in, rolling on the rocks and roaring.</p>

            <p>JUGGS. Little decanters.</p>

            <p>JUMM.-A noise of a singular nature; it is a deep hollow</p>

            <p>sound, which comes from the wild rocks of a sea-shore in the time of a storm, when the ocean is highly agitated; it forms as it were the bass to a sounding surf, and is heard by a keen naturalist to be a sound distinct by itself; it is not the sound of the troubled waters, nor the sound of the hurling peebles, but the sound that these combined draw out of the rocks by striking them; it is one of the wildest and most awful sounds in nature; it is just jumm, jumm, on a high and tremendous key.</p>

            <p>matter.</p>

            <p>JURR. The noise a small water-fall makes, when it falls amongst loose stones and gravel.</p>

            <p>KAIM-CLEANERS.-In old houses, by the side of the fireplace, horse-hair is found stuck in the holes of the "standards" of wood which support the old walls; this hair was used for cleaning combs. A person once told me, "that there was a bunch of hair for this purpose drilled into the hole of an oak beam, in an old house he lived in; and that this hair, though frequently cut with a knife close to the wood, soon grew out again as long as ever." From this, one may think that oak will give life to hair: the same person said," that if one be buried in an oak coffin, the hair won't decay like the other matters belonging to the body, but continue to grow." These things must be better investigated, though I have heard that the nature of hair has puzzled able heads.</p>

            <p>Now the tempest south is howling,</p>

            <p>Grumbling waves in anger rolling :</p>

            <p>Lash, dash, snow and hail,</p>

            <p>Ye mountain torrents never fail,</p>

            <p>Sweep down the snoring herd,</p>

            <p>Down with the flowery swaird;</p>

            <p>Sheep and goats all there,</p>

            <p>Hallo! On it pours,</p>

            <p>Rain first, then sleety showers;</p>

            <p>The wind whistles while it blows,</p>

            <p>Nipping hail, smooring snows;</p>

            <p>Rash, splash, it feels the charm,</p>

            <p>Burnbeckers neath the brow,</p>

            <p>The water-rat, obliged to swim</p>

            <p>For rest to the grassy brim.</p>

            <p>Get ye into water deep</p>

            <p>Ye hirrlings, and therein sleep;</p>

            <p>Now the froth, now the bubbles</p>

            <p>Gather in behind the cobles,</p>

            <p>Now the moon I cannot see,</p>

            <p>Brother stand there and watch,</p>

            <p>While I remain here and catch.</p>

            <p>What is this, a craig o'heron?</p>

            <p>Hah, lad, you've got your fairing,</p>

            <p>Here again, what are you?</p>

            <p>Rotten sheep, bow, wow.</p>

            <p>So, brother, what is this,</p>

            <p>Something surely not amiss;</p>

            <p>Garments like the azure swimming,</p>

            <p>Border'd round with silver trimming,</p>

            <p>A woman, oh! perhaps a maid,</p>

            <p>See her hair is out of braid;</p>

            <p>Poor heavenly, earthly creature,</p>

            <p>Far the loveliest work of nature-</p>

            <p>Third kelpie</p>

            <p>Alive she is, I heard her sigh,</p>

            <p>Bear her up in air high,</p>

            <p>If she be a virgin blooming,</p>

            <p>Free from art, unassuming,</p>

            <p>Surely to her we will give</p>

            <p>The fluid whereupon to live;</p>

            <p>But if she be not so,</p>

            <p>Down the torrent she shall go,</p>

            <p>These are eyes none but a maid,</p>

            <p>Ever had, ever had.</p>

            <p>We will guard her from the storm,</p>

            <p>KELTON-HILL-FAIR.-This is one of the largest meetings or gatherings of Gallovidians that are to be met with. This fair is held on a day about Midsummer, every year, on rising ground beside the clauchan of Rhonhouse, in the parish of Kelton. At this fair one is gratified with a sight of the peasantry of both Scotland and Ireland; and here may sometimes be lifted a tolerable idea of the Donnybrook of Erin, or Ballinasloe; at one time in danger of having the scull bared with a cudgel; at other times hemmed in, as it were, with rowly-powly men, fling sticks, and sweetiewives. Then the ears get charmed with the hoarse throats of ballad singers, and not unfrequently nearly rode over with horse-jockies. And all this humbug and justling combined form the best of fun; one gets delighted. Tennants Anster rather seems flatter than the reality, though <pb n="293" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA293#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />sometimes we see with the drollish poet. While the scenes thicken, the tents get crowded; whisky is skilted over like whey; bonny lasses are to be met with, who cling round one like binwud; and who would not cling to them in return, sweet souls? For an hour or two of bustling nonsense, then. I know of few places where it is to be had in greater perfection than at Kelton-hill-fair.</p>

            <p>KEND GRUN.-Land we are acquainted with; yet sometimes we wander on kend grun in misty nights, and walk fast until we entirely bewilder ourselves; in such trying times, it is the best plan to sit down in some dry beil, until more light be flung on the subject. Writers, too, when they leave kend grun, are apt to go wrong, if they have not a genius of a vast nature to bring them back; they are like navigators having lost all reckoning in the midst of a dreary ocean. Small wits, like myself, should never launch largely out to the shores; for if we try to flash with witches and ghosts beyond the cloud, like Shakspeare, or soar, like Milton, into regions far beyond our knowledge, we are apt to rue the day we ever left kend grun. But, as I said when I began this subject, we may wander even on kend grun; so I may run myself wrong in Gallowa, a land I weel ken,</p>

            <p>sea, but keep dabbling about</p>

            <p>KENK. To cough, having a severe cough. Kenkhoast, the chin-cough. To cure this, the mothers put their children through the happers of mills, when they fancy it leaves them.</p>

            <p>KENT.-A large long staff; also a tall person.</p>

            <p>KEP. To intercept, so as to catch; but the word does not go so far as some will have it, of absolute catching; kepping is nothing more than " opposing and wearing;" "he kepped the ball" means, he so weared in the ball with his hands, that he got hold of it.</p>

            <p>KERMONT, the TANNER-A good composer of songs, and a Gallovidian born and bred I believe. He is a tanner by trade, and wrought sometime at Mr. Grayson's tanneree, Kirkcudbright, but has removed from thence some years ago, and gone to Newtonstewart. His songs are very natural, and contain some good strokes of humour. I could name twenty persons and more in the south of Scotland who write songs, but then their effusions are so made up of art, that I refrain from speaking of them. Kermont, though, methinks is an exception. His "Lammas Fair," is a good song, but his " Laury o' Broom, Sir," is famous. Some say he got help to compose it, but I do not think so. I shall give it here as a curiosity. The song of "Cankerd King Cowan," written by an Irishman, for a Gallovidian lay, and this song of Laury o' Broom, done in the Irish style, by a Gallovidian, are things very amusing</p>

            <p>LAURY O' BROOM, SIR.</p>

            <p>I am, do ye hear me, a weaver to trade,</p>

            <p>And my name it is Laury o' Broom, Sir,</p>

            <p>My father he died, left me all that he had,</p>

            <p>Hoch! a good breeding sow and a loom, Sir.</p>

            <p>I lived quite happy a very short space,</p>

            <p>Then I married a wife who soon altered the case,</p>

            <p>She black'd both my eyes, and she spat in my face,</p>

            <p>It was tight times for Laury o' Broom, Sir,</p>

            <p>I thought to myself, that this would not long do,</p>

            <p>My passion I could not well smother,</p>

            <p>So I instantly sold off my loom and my sow,</p>

            <p>And I pack'd the wife home to her mother.</p>

            <p>Being thus, then, set free, I for Scotland did steer,</p>

            <p>I left the sweet place that was once to me dear,</p>

            <p>Whilst grief in my bosom was like to go tear</p>

            <p>The heart of poor Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>On a staff o'er my shoulder my bundle I slung,</p>

            <p>My figure was one of the oddest,</p>

            <p>I did not know which was the right road or wrong,</p>

            <p>But I stuck to the one that was broadest.</p>

            <p>And at length I arrived at Donachadie,</p>

            <p>Where I found to my grief I was stopp'd by the sea,</p>

            <p>Then I wish'd I'd had wings, like the swallow, to flee,</p>

            <p>What a bird would be Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <pb n="295" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA295#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>But I got aboard of a tight little smack,</p>

            <p>Just afraid's I'd been bound for the gallows,</p>

            <p>Yet to keep up my spirits, I sang " Paddywhack,"</p>

            <p>As she toss'd o'er the turbulent billows.</p>

            <p>At length I grew sick, and was like to go die,</p>

            <p>My belly of meat it was empty, quite dry,</p>

            <p>Hoch! I lay all besmear'd, like a pig in a sty,</p>

            <p>And "A Doctor," cried Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>But the winds and the waters gave over to roar,</p>

            <p>And I mended, and jumped on deck, Sir, Then went up the mast-ladder, to view Ireland once more, To the danger and risk of my neck, Sir.</p>

            <p>Tho', alas! dear Hibernia was hid from my view,</p>

            <p>I was damn'd to come down by the captain and crew,</p>

            <p>Then I thought on my wife, and my loom and my sow;</p>

            <p>But far distant was Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>Then I found out the place where the "ship's clock” it lay,</p>

            <p>But 'twas too much for my comprehending,</p>

            <p>I asked at the "skipper" the time of the day,</p>

            <p>But he, smiling, replied, she was standing.</p>

            <p>The "sea-travel" seem'd very lonesome to me,</p>

            <p>Because not a mile-stone I ever could see,</p>

            <p>Nor an ale-house to call at from Donachadie,</p>

            <p>To cheer up poor Laury o' Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>At the quay of the port, then, we got to at last,</p>

            <p>And our big flying sheets we did lower, Sir,</p>

            <p>I thought all my perilous dangers were past,</p>

            <p>When I got with my brogues to the shore, Sir,</p>

            <p>A "tenpennie" paid for my passage, and then</p>

            <p>I shoulder'd my bundle and cudgell again,</p>

            <p>Ha, honey, farewel, said the captain and men,</p>

            <p>I'm your servant, quoth Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>So the smack then I left, as you easily guess,</p>

            <p>And took a walk looking about me,</p>

            <p>A man he gives two or three peeps at my dress,</p>

            <p>And thus he began to salute me :-</p>

            <p>Do you know what the "croppies" in Ireland do now,</p>

            <p>Or whether their numbers be many, or how?</p>

            <p>By my soul, neither croppies nor Ireland I know,</p>

            <p>I'm a Scotchman, says Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>But quoth he, your a croppie, by the "cut of your hair;"</p>

            <p>This struck me with terror and wonder,</p>

            <p>So I instantly flung up his heels in the air,</p>

            <p>Hoch! I laid him as flat as a flounder.</p>

            <p>Then off I did run, till I came to Glenluce,</p>

            <p>As frightened's a crow, and as dizzy's a goose,</p>

            <p>And whenever a person peep'd out of a house,</p>

            <p>I'm a madman, cried Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <pb n="296" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>Being wearied at last tho', I stopp'd at an inn,</p>

            <p>The head public-house in the place, Sir,</p>

            <p>I pop'd into the parlour, and called for some gin,</p>

            <p>The people stood all in amaze, Sir.</p>

            <p>So I told I was a nobleman's son in disguise,</p>

            <p>But the landlady told me my story was lies,</p>

            <p>Sweet Paddie for ever, the landlord he cries,</p>

            <p>And out he kick'd Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>From that hell of a shop, then, I soon did dismiss,</p>

            <p>And thought on my loom and my sow, Sir,</p>

            <p>My wife, tho' the devil, was nothing to this,</p>

            <p>And a sigh from my bosom she drew, Sir.</p>

            <p>The scenes of my youth then came fresh in my mind,</p>

            <p>My little turf but, where once happiness reigned,</p>

            <p>Hoch! Fortune thou'rt fickler far than the wind,</p>

            <p>How ye change with poor Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>My spirits, however, I keeped up still,</p>

            <p>And pass'd o'er the wild Corse o' Slakes, Sir,</p>

            <p>A fellow came up and cried "clean Kelton-hill,"</p>

            <p>We went into a "tent," soon, of stakes, Sir.</p>

            <p>The whisky came round, there I drank and I sang,</p>

            <p>The boxing began, and the cudgels they rang,</p>

            <p>And right in the stomach I got such a bang,</p>

            <p>That hearted poor Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>But soon I came to, and my mother o' the sloe,</p>

            <p>I whacked about with my might, Sir,</p>

            <p>And or I knew rightly a friend from a foe,</p>

            <p>My wrists were in the figure eight, Sir.</p>

            <p>So some then did kick me, and some did me trail,</p>

            <p>I wished that my coat had been a coat of mail,</p>

            <p>So snugly just here in Kircubrie's old jail,</p>

            <p>At last they've got Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>Hoh, Fortune, you've blown me a damnable blast,</p>

            <p>And my folly you near make me rue, Sir,</p>

            <p>I wish I was o'er the "long bridge o' Belfast,"</p>

            <p>Again to my loom and my sow, Sir.</p>

            <p>For hunger at home and a day whiles of strife,</p>

            <p>Between a poor boy and a hell of a wife,</p>

            <p>Are innocent things to a rambling life,</p>

            <p>What a witness is Laury O'Broom, Sir.</p>

            <p>So much then, and perhaps too much, of Laury O'Broom, Sir.. I never could catch a very correct copy of this stave, so was compelled to add words and lines of verses as I went on, to keep the sense together; and at the last I was obliged to ask my own wayward muse for three full verses.</p>

            <p>KIBBLING-A rude stick or rung. Some put great value</p>

            <p>Sweet mother of the sloe,</p>

            <p>Hoch! where did ye grow?</p>

            <p>On the banks of the lovely Ban-water;</p>

            <p>KILT-Proper method, right way, or right thing. We say of such a one that is not properly up to his trade, that he has not the kilt of it, and of those who well understand what they are doing, that they have the kilt o't. Can this word, and kilt, a loose garment, be one? I know not: probably, the Highland clans long ago used the phrase," ye have the kilt o't," to those of the same tribe or dress with themselves, and those who were not, of course had not the kilt of it. The following tolerable verses were composed in a church, on seeing a countryman asleep while a priest, (who had not the kilt of preaching), was holding forth. Probably kilt and kent-to know, are one :—</p>

            <p>KILTED Clothes furled up on the body are said to be "kilted."</p>

            <p>KILTIE-A spawned salmon; they are then very lean.</p>

            <p>KIMMER-A gude-wife.</p>

            <p>KIMMERINS-The feasts at births. These, the "Kimmers, or gude-wives, have to themselves; no men are allowed to partake along with them. KING AND QUEEN O' CANTELON-A chief school game. Two of the swiftest of the boys are placed between two doons, or places of safety; these, perhaps, two hundred yards distant. All the other boys stand in one of these places or doons, when the two fleet youths come forward, and address them with this rhyme</p>

            <p>"King and Queen o' Cantelon,</p>

            <p>"How mony mile to Babylon;</p>

            <p>"Six or seven, or a lang eight,</p>

            <p>"Try to win there wi' candle-light."</p>

            <p>When out, they run in hopes to get to Babylon, or the other doon, but many of them get not near that place before they are caught by the runners. Who taens them, that is, lay their hands upon their heads, when they are not allowed to run any more in that game, that is, until they all be taend or taken. This sport has something, methinks, of antiquity in it; it seemeth to be a pantomime of some scenes played off in the time of the Crusades. King and Queen o' Cantelon evidently must be King and Queen o' Caledon, but slightly changed by time. Then, Babylon in the rhyme, the way they had to wander, and hazard the being caught by the Infidels, all speak as to the foundation of the game.</p>

            <p>KING GALDERS-On the farm of Cairnholly, in the parish of Kirkmabreck, stands a rarity, the large stone coffin <pb n="301" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />which held the body of a king, which tradition calls "King Gulders." It is at the present day, just as it has been all along; such a weighty concern has preserved it from being removed. Around the tomb are many stones of various lengths standing on end.</p>

            <p>Murray, in his history, refers to the account of a King Galdus, by a person named Sympson, and that his tomb is beside the Blednoch water. The two kings must be one, and how it comes he has two tombs, 1 cannot say; the two places are many miles distant. Galders was probably a Dane, and the conjecture that Galloway derived her name from him, is not unlikely.</p>

            <p>KIRKCORMOCK.-An ancient Gallovidian parish, like Dunroddan, Gatah, Senwick, Kirkandros, and others. The <pb n="302" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />names of such only remain now, and their kirk-yards, with perhaps the ruins of the auld kirk. At Dunroddan, the fount, which held the holy water, is yet to be seen in a fine state of perfection; a blacksmith lately thought it might answer him for a troch, so introduced it into his smiddy; but a worthy kirk-yard antiquary, whom I and many others could name, restored it to its ancient situaation; the kirk-yard of Kirkcormock is worthy of remark, on account of an old troch stane, three feet by two therein; to translate its inscription was no small trouble, the characters being of old runic stamp, and the language Latin. "Honorabilis Sir Patricius Maclellana qui obit anno M.DXXXIV. anno XVIII. Etatis." This gentleman seems to have been one of Maclellans of Auchlane, by a daughter of Herries, the second Lord Herries, who died (the lady) in the same year; had the stone not been broke through at the middle, and otherways mutilated, more of its inscription might have been gathered. In this kirkyard there is also a little tumulus, but lately much injured by a planting of young trees. O! ye moderns, have mercy on the</p>

            <p>memory of</p>

            <p>your</p>

            <p>ancestors.</p>

            <p>KIRKCUBRIE-Kirkcudbright. Not only the metropolis of Galloway, but a curiosity of itself, so it therefore lays double claim to my attention, though I am not going to say much about it. That it is ancient; that its name comes from St. Cuthbert; that it now is a place containing from two to three thousand inhabitants; that though on a fine navigable river, it has little trade; these, and other things are all in print already, and I print nothing over again if I know it. But few, perhaps, are aware, that Willie Wallace used to ship from this place to the court of France. South of the town is his camp; this royal borough has many bonny lasses in it; shall I name a few? No, names are odious; though, were I to do so, they would get husbands in a handclap; there are also some very <pb n="303" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA303#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />social men in it, with whom I have spent some happy hours, but there are foolish men in it also, and many very fond of drink, termed tipplers; and, like all little places ̧ it is full of scandal, what not; but on the whole I have never loved any small town so well as Kirkcubrie. KIRKING. That ceremony of attending the kirk the first Sabbath after marriage; to the modest this is the most trying concern in the matter, and commonly the man blushes deeper than the woman; she seems quite uplifted, having caught a husband, but not so he, because he has got a wife; a number of friends and relatives generally attend the young fowk on these occasions; the bride comes forward linked or huiked, in the bridegroom's best man's arm, and to this party are directed all eyes in the church. What a nonsense in truth is to be borne with, before an honest man can enter the matrimonial state. I could wager, that in the space of twenty or thirty years, gieing up the names, crying, kirking, &amp;c. will be all dead and damned, like the cutty stool; as so they should, for. where is their use? and the evil attending them is great; in this age of light, the church laws in Scotland keep many from marriage, for what is worse to endure than foolish ceremonies? they do well enough when the eyes of the mind are glazed with ignorance, but now they will not do at all. I would not go through with them, as they exist at present in my native kirk, were I sure to gain the loveliest and richest female in Britain.</p>

            <p>KIRK-LADDLES-The laddles or implements elders use in rustic kirks, to gather the bawbees the congregations bring with them for the poor fowk.</p>

            <p>KIRK-STILES-The stepping stones people walk over church-yard dykes on. At these places, of course, the greatest crowd generally stands, on Sabbath days; there the bonny lasses shew themselves with their best braws on to the young cheels, and they in return flash before them their watch seals, braid claith, neat baws, what not, which <pb n="304" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA304#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />is returning love for love; by degrees the flames burn brisker, so that many have cause to both bless and rue the day, they ever met wi ither at kirk-stiles.</p>

            <p>KIRNIE.-A little pert impudent boy, who would wish to be considered a man.</p>

            <p>KIRNING-Churning. The art of making butter; the upstaning kirn, is but little used now for that purpose, only those who have little cream make use of it; the barrle and box kirns have quite displaced it. But still the doughty wife of Auchtermuchties will be well understood; yes, even though we adopt the South American's method of churning. About Buenos Ayres, says my famous wanderer, Sawnie the Sailor, green hides are sewed together in the form of a large bag; the cream, or ratherly the whole of the milk, is then poured in, for there is no cream on the milk in warm countries; this bag, when about full, is tied with a rope to a horse's tail, which drags it scampering through the streets, until by agitation it becomes coagulated.</p>

            <p>KIRNS.-Harvest sports, after harvest is concluded; also, the last hookful of grain that is to be cut, is called a kirn; who to cut this is a great matter; the rip left is three plaited, the reapers range back a few yards, and fling at it with their hooks, and he or she who flings, and cuts it, is accounted the cleverest in the boon or banwun. That, at the dancing ateen, he or she wears in the hat or bonnet like a soldier's feather, the whole of the night, beautifully busked with ribbons of various hues. Afterwards it is hung up in a conspicuous part of the house, and given to Bill Jock, the king o' the Byre, on Auld Candlemas-day, so that none of the kye, the incoming year may be guilty of picking-cauve. Ranting kirns are now bid farewel to Galloway almost; refinement and the inroads of low Irish reapers, are the cause; anciently the famous laird o' Senwick used to send for a fiddler out of Dumfries, to give <pb n="305" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA305#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />music to his kirns, a distance of thirty miles; this was running the matter to a high pitch.</p>

            <p>KIRNSTAFF. That long staff with a circular frame on the head of it, used anciently, when " upstanding kirns” were fashionable.</p>

            <p>KIRR.-Blythe, cheerful, &amp;c.: a person so inclined is said to be a kirr body.</p>

            <p>KIRSENING or CRISENING.-Christening, the ceremony of baptism; to these, large parties are invited, and feasting and fun are the result; the sketch of a curious scene, seen at one of these meetings, runneth thus</p>

            <p>At a kirsening yesterday down in the glen,</p>

            <p>War assembled a possey o' crouse honest men,</p>

            <p>Wha cracket their jokes, and discussed the wather,</p>

            <p>The hinnie, the short-bread on ither did cram.</p>

            <p>The cups round the trays in their orbits war placed,</p>

            <p>A couple o' track pots the system weel graced,</p>

            <p>What a glorious sight, see the kettle a reeking,</p>

            <p>LAIGH-FIEL.-Low lands, the reverse of the moor lands</p>

            <p>thus we say a Laigh-fiel farm, a Laigh fiel lass, &amp;c. / LAIRD. The lord of a manor; some of these are the best, and others the worst characters in Scotland; who has not heard of Laird Wiggiewussock? his lands lay on the Solway shore. Greedy as the grave was he, his gourmand imagination saw an island off his shore a little way, once in seven years. Thus would he describe it :-" O! it was a bonny big isle; I saw gran swankies o' nowt on't, feeding on rough claver fiels; rare corn growing too, every stalk o't as thick as my wee finger, and ilka head wad hae filled my gowpins. Apple trees I saw there, wi' apples hinging swagging on them like warping clues, the haleware o't seemed to be gran plowable lan. I cud hae made sillar on't, like sclate stanes." (Then would he add)" O! if I had <pb n="308" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />got a spunk o' kennelling on't, it a' wad hae become my ain; the Manxmen's Isle was ance enchanted the same way, but a spark o' fire lighted on't ance frae out a sailor's pipe, broke the charm, whilk has hinner'd it to sink mair; but war a' the fires at ony time to gang out, it wad just gae whar it was again; ance they went a' out but ae wee bit gleed in Laxy, and faith, the Isle o' Man was begun to shog and quake."</p>

            <p>Mine reverend original, Nathan M'Kie, was once obliged to leave his rural abode, the Manse o' Baulmagie, and go to London on some important business; his friends in the mighty metropolis were glad to see him, and introduced the worthy eccentric every where, as a piece of great curiosity. A young German lady, hearing of Nathan, in some of her gay circles, wished very much to be some evening where he was, to see the rare Scotch clergyman, the which wish she was soon gratified with; after chatting with the strange man, in rather a saucy way, she asked at him if he knew "what kind of an animal a Scottish laird was?" adding, at the same time, that she had "read Buffon, Linnæus, and other naturalists, without finding any satisfaction." Nathan turned his queer phiz towards her, and quoth-(giving himself a hursle or twa at the same time)" Wi' faith, madam, I'm nae great naturalist either, but I believe the Scottish laird to be an animal unco like your petty German prince ahame, in being baith damned poor, and as proud.”</p>

            <p>LAIR'D.-Stuck in mire. The Moorlands in particular are</p>

            <p>full of dangerous places for animals to sink in; these seem green and inviting, but no sooner are they entered upon than they are found to be all a deception.</p>

            <p>"I set af tae Moors ance (quoth a Lowland farmer), to buy a wheen fogging ewes; I had the Mall mare aneath me, the best stump o' a beast ever I had; owre ae hag after anither I rade, and crossed mony a garry, till every bane in my body was sair."</p>

            <p>My chief moor house was Drummruck; there was 1 steering, when down sunk the Mall mare wi' a snore, in ane o' thae green flow bogs; I gaed on tae tap o'a bie hill, and wow'd wi' my hat, and in less than a quarter of an hour ten herds, wi' twice as mony dogs, gathered to me: we gaed down tae mare, pull'd, and better pull'd; I dare say we had to draw her near hauf a mile, afore we cam to steave grun.</p>

            <p>"The poor brute was a' racked to pieces, and never was like the same beast after. I gaed the lads shillings apiece, and ane I gaed hauf-a-crown to, to guide me to the road that led hame. Sae I gat back again, but if ever I ride sic anither fool erran, it will be de'ils queer to me."</p>

            <p>LAIRD COWTART-Or the obstinate man. His proper name was James Coltart; he was a labouring man, as I am told, the greater part of his life; and whether he became heir to a little house and garden in the suburbs of Kirkcudbright, or obtained it by his own honest industry, I know not; however, a little laird he was, and went the most of his days under the name of Laird Cowlart. He was the most attentive man to his word ever known in Galloway. What he at any time said, that he would have abided by to the last. For a trifling wager, he sat the length of a summer day once on the "rigging of a barn,” with his face to the wind, not flinching an inch from Boreas; at another time, for a similar bet, he sat upon a brow for a whole day, and gazed directly at the sun; no eagle ever looked Sol so boldly in the face. There was a merchant in Kirkcudbright, of the name of Harris, who sold groceries; this person and the laird once disputed about something, and our obstinate man said "he would purchase nothing out of his shop more, nor allow himself to taste of any of his wares." The laird's wife, however, who knew nothing of her husband's determination, bought some candles from Harris; on their being used for lighting <pb n="310" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />up the house, the good man inquired of her, "where she had bought them?" on being told from Harris, he spread his grey plaid between the candle and him, in order to keep himself out of its hateful light. Another time the mistress purchased from this merchant some barley for the broth, the laird knew not of the matter, till he had dined on the said broth; so in his stomach they should not remain, he raged about, and there was no peace in the house, until the laird had disgorged what of them he had swallowed, every "groat." He used to make "beeskeps,” in the evenings, when his day's work was over, that's to say, his "day's work" with those with whom he was employed; once while so engaged, out before his door in the open air, the wife came and called him to supper; he said "he would come if she did not call him again," the wife forgot though, came out after a little, and called James to come in to his "champed potatoes;"-" ay, ay, gude wife," he exclaimed, "ye hae done for me now;" as usual he held by his word, and amused himself sitting out all night. Being challenged once, coming through a field, by its tenant, that he had no right to come that way, the laird said, “his feet should never touch the grass of that field more;" some of the laird's fellow-labourers heard of his determination, and bore him into the field by force; there he lay on his back with his feet up in the air, and roared and cried so mightily, that they were obliged to bear him out of it again. I could multiply specimens of obstinacy, this way, for a long time, and give many of his singular sayings, but these may suffice; be drove a mule in a little cart long, and many thought he and the mule were a "dead match;" he was always considered to be rigidly honest, was well liked, and the good family of Selkirk was all along very kind to him.</p>

            <p>LAIRD O' COOL'S GHAIST.-We have not a more popular tale or pamphlet in Galloway, than the one bearing the title of this article. The Laird o' Cool flourished about <pb n="311" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />one hundred years ago, in the parish of Buittle; he was proprietor of a farm therein, called Cool, and how he became so was never rightly known; it is the belief of all, however, that there was foul play in the matter, either by getting wills and deeds signed by dead mens' hands, or some such way. When this laird left the world, as other men do, his ghaist or ghost, returned soon after; was seen by many stegging about the estate, like a thing in trouble, to the terror of the people about; it was frequently seen sitting down on a stone, termed a cool stane; at length the priest of the parish would lay him, a thing of the most serious nature in those days; the ghaist gave him the reasons why it could not remain in darkness for the deeds it had done when in the flesh; all of which crimes the priest promised to remedy, if it would trouble the land of light no more; so, by praying and circumscribing circles with cauk and keel, the terrific task was accomplished, the laird's ghaist sank into the earth, and has never more burst the cerements of the tomb.</p>

            <p>LAIRING STAFF.-A staff used by herd boys to drive the flocks to their lair; sometimes it is termed the lairer. LAMETER-A cripple. The dialogue of two beggars, who met once on a country-cross road, ran thus:-"What's come o' daughter Mary, now?" quoth the one to other; "Mary? she's married," was the reply; and "wha has Mary gotten?" added the inquirer; "a braw horsecripple," answered the mither. "Weel done Mary! (said the other) we maun hae a blaw o' the pipe owre that thegether." LAMMAS SPATES.-Those heavy falls of rain, common about Lammas or Midsummer. Farmers who live by the banks of waters, prepare themselves against the falling of these spates or spouts, by removing every thing out of the river's way; that though it swells, and comes foaming down, it can do them no injury; not rob them of their wunter's fodder.</p>

            <p>LAMPER EELS.-Eels, common in spring wells during summer; they are so much like horse-hair, that the folks think it is hair alive; they even put hair in the water to see if it will become lamper eels, but I have never known the trial to succeed. It is wonderful to examine these lampreys, to see they are things of life, and seemingly without either head or tail; cut them in twenty pieces, each piece is just a little eel, having the same motions, be it one inch, or be it ten in length.</p>

            <p>LAN-EN'.-The end of ridges.</p>

            <p>LANDIN-Landing. Ending with a "set," at shearing,</p>

            <p>cutting through from one side of the field to the other. LANGLES-Manacles. Home-made fetters. LANG MEGS.-A name for a species of long apple.</p>

            <p>"Gude</p>

            <p>LANG-NEBBED.-Having a long beak, bill, or uib; preserve us frae a' witches, warlocks, and lang-nebbed things;" this is one of the greatest wishes of the country people; they consider that some of the beings of the nocturnal world have sonsy snouts, like powder-horns. Words too, in the English tongue, difficult to be understood, are said to be lang-nebbed or double-breasted; sometime ago at country schools, when the scholars were learning to read the buik, whenever they came to a cramp word to pronounce, the Dominies bade them call that a passover, and syne skelp awa." It may be added too, that some of those windy terms in the nomenclatures of our modern sciences, are truly lang-nebbed, and may be made passovers by sensible men.</p>

            <p>LAPPELS. The folds on the front of a coat.</p>

            <p>LAPPER.-Snow in the act of melting. Lapper'd, curdled. "The milk sits lapper'd in the dirty coags," saith poor Bob Fergusson, as bright a young genius as ever sang on the earth. "The lapper'd cluds conglobe and roll,” saith another author-perhaps myself.</p>

            <p>LAW.-A high hill.</p>

            <p>LAYING GHAISTS.-When ghosts showed their pale faces in the days of yore, the ministers of the word laid them by praying; that is to say, they described circles, stood within them (for over the circumference of a circle no ghaist durst pass), and there they addressed the foul spirit, until it sunk into the earth; they then crossed the place with lines, which hindered them from rising any</p>

            <p>more.</p>

            <p>Auld sang.</p>

            <p>LAYING SHEEP.-The art of putting greasy matters on sheep, so that they may be kept warmer through winter. See the article Sheep-smearing.</p>

            <p>LEAD O' THE ICE.-A curler's phrase, and means the bias of ice. Many, however, when they do not play well, ascribe their bad success to the unevenness of the ice; man, generally speaking, being loath to take a fault to himself.</p>

            <p>LEAD THE ICE.-Another curler's term, being the order</p>

            <p>given to the first player, when about to play; also to any player, when stones are in the direct way to the " tee.” LEE. The ashes of green weeds, such as breckans; when burned, gude wives use it in bleaching; also, lee, to lie, to tell fibs or untruths; and also, lee, a place surrounded by hills, an open space, yet sheltered from almost every blast. What for a song, is</p>

            <p>LEEMERS.-Nuts which leave their husks easily.</p>

            <p>LEESE. To arrange, to trim, to sort, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>LEESH. A piece of tough string.</p>

            <p>LEESH-FALLOWs.-Tough strong fellows.</p>

            <p>LET ON. A phrase, meaning "the giving a hint of any thing;" never "let-on," we say to those whom we wish to keep secret some little thing we have told them; that is to say, not to hint the matter to any other. LETTERED-CRAIGS.-In various places of Galloway, large crags are to be met with, having very ancient writings on them, some of which the antiquary deciphers, but others not; one of these, in the farm of Knockiebay in the Shire, has cut deep on the upper side</p>

            <p>"Lift me up, and I'll tell ye more." Many people have, in separate years, as time rolls on, gathered to this rock, and after much labour, have succeeded in lifting it up, with the hopes, no doubt, of <pb n="315" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA315#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />being well repaid for their trouble with the treasure beneath; but how must they have been deceived, when, instead of finding any gold, they find wrote on its ground side,</p>

            <p>"Lay me down as I was before."</p>

            <p>It must have been no small wag in the days away, who invented this. On another, in a neighbouring parish, this strange inscription is found cut</p>

            <p>"This stane lies on auld Robbin's wame,</p>

            <p>"His purse and his staff are aside the same,</p>

            <p>"If thou thinks this wrang, tak the stane af my wame,</p>

            <p>"And lay it on thine to preserve thy name."</p>

            <p>Sawners M'Clurg, the old innkeeper, at Blednoch Brig, about eighty years ago, allowed almost every kind of wildness to go on in his house, except fighting; and whenever any rustics started a collieshangie, Sawners reached for a thick stick, he kept up in the brace, and being a very strong man, stood up and gave the ground one thump with it, saying, quietness is best; when quietness instantly took place. At last, when he went the way of all men, a friend laid a rude rock on him, with this epitaph deeply engraved on it</p>

            <p>"Beneath lies Sawners M'Clurg,</p>

            <p>"Enjoying his quiet rest,</p>

            <p>"When he was alive he ay said,</p>

            <p>"Quietness was best."</p>

            <p>This inscription nearly pleases me as well as that one a fellow blabbed carelessly out, on his master, who offered fifty pounds, to him who should write the best thing on his grave-stone :—</p>

            <p>"Here lies Billy Knox,</p>

            <p>"Wha lived and died like ither folks."</p>

            <p>So he cheated many a learned poet.</p>

            <p>LEUG. A tall, ill-looking man.</p>

            <p>LEW-A heat. Stacks of corn are said to take a "lew," when they are built, not being dry, when they heat.</p>

            <p>LEWRE.-A long pole, a lever.</p>

            <pb n="316" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA316#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>LEZIE.-The name for Elizabeth.</p>

            <p>LICHTS. The lungs of an animal.</p>

            <p>LIDDERIE.-Feeble and lazy.</p>

            <p>LIDED. Mixed, thickened, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>LIFT.—A term much in use at rustic funerals; let us lift, say those people at these occasions, when they have had five or six services; which means, let us lift the corpse and be going, for we have had enough, though it is well known not to be come to that time yet, and that all they want by repeating often, let us lift, boys, is to have another service, or round of bread, cheese, and whisky, so that when lifting time comes, some of those drunken, and gormandizing mourners can scarcely lift themselves, never speaking of being able to lift others. To lift a brae, is to ascend a brow. Lift, also means the whole of the sky, that can be seen at once; anciently, says tradition, the people fancied that there were some mighty persons far above the firmament, who had always in lift, as it were, the whole of the celestial regions, and who hindered the clouds and heavenly bodies from absolutely falling on them, and that they carried the clouds from place to place, as they thought fit; hence the word carry; these were the times when "spirits came on the blast," and ruled the whirlwind and the storm,</p>

            <p>LIGGETT A reclining gate-from lig, to recline, and gate;</p>

            <p>they must recline, or they would not close of themselves; they are hung on what is termed a hangrell; in the holdstone at the foot is a bot to turn on, called a bot-stane; the long bar which crosses the others obliquely, is the sord.</p>

            <p>LINCLUDEN. A venerable old college in ruins, standing on the lovely banks of Nith, a little above Dumfries.— Francis Grose, in bis antiquities of Scotland, takes notice of it, but as he has not spoke about matters to be met <pb n="317" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA317#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />with at this place, respecting Galloway, it becomes me to do so. On entering the chancel, one is struck with awe and wonder, at seeing the remains of ancient grandeur, of the most beautiful workmanship and decoration; what first attracts notice, is the tomb of Margaret, eldest daughter of King Robert the Third, sister of the gallant King James the First, (who was cruelly murdered at Perth, by his uncle, cousin, and others, who were his confidants) and wife of Archibald, fourth Earl of Douglass, and first Duke of Touraine in France, (who was slain at the battle of Vernuil, 17th August, 1424, and lies buried in the church of St. Gratian, in Tours, the capital of his duchy). Margaret was alive May, 1426; over the tomb is inscribed, in Gothic characters--</p>

            <p>A l'aide de Micu.</p>

            <p>"HIC JACET, ANA MARGARETTA, REGIS Scocie, FILIA QUODA COMITISSA DE DOUGLAS ANA GALWIDIE ET VALLIS ANADIE."</p>

            <p>Her tomb-stone, which has no inscription, is lying broken in the grave. This tomb is beautifully decorated all round and over the top; in the midst of the decorations is the representation of three large chalices or cups, intermixed with a heart and three stars, the arms of the Douglasses; the former from the heart of Robert Bruce, entrusted to the good Sir James; and the stars, by marriage with the heiress of Bothwell, in the person of Archibald, the third earl, commonly called the grim. On the left of this beautiful tomb, which should be told, is on the north wall of the chancel, is a door much ornamented; over it is cut out the heart, stars, and lion rampant; the latter, the arms of Galloway, of which the Douglasses were lords. On both sides of the wall in the chancel are many shields, some with arms, some plain; but in those having arms, the lion, heart, and stars, prevail; over one of the shields, and cut out on the south wall, (supposed to belong <pb n="318" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA318#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />to Stewart of Bonkill,) is a scroll, with a few words in the Gothic or Saxon character, but which stands so high that it is impossible to decipher the inscription with a common ladder; on the whole, this college is a noble old pile, and worthy of walking a long summer day to see. What holy emblems and inscriptions there are about it!-the Three in one, surrounded by a glory, viz. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, with the words Jesu Christi, frequently appear; also Mary and the Child, with the seven wise men kneeling before them; and, according to the Golden Legend, the two first figures of this group seem armed. I may add, that Margaret, mentioned already, daughter of King Robert the Third, whose husband was Archibald, the fourth Earl of Douglass, was nicknamed Tyne Man, from the many battles he tyned or lost, and his general unsuccess; he was wounded at Hamilton, and taken prisoner by Hotspur Percy; refused to be delivered up to King Henry the Fourth. This and other bad blood was the pretence for the Percy rebelling, where defeat attended them, and where Douglass was made prisoner by Henry the Fourth, 1403. It seems, the inscription was made before either Maggie, or her grim husband died; as he had the gift of the duchy of Touraine, April, 1424, and fell in battle, August the same year. Now, the wife was alive May, 1426, for at this date she had a charter" To Margaret, Duchess of Touraine, Countess of Douglass, Lady of Galloway and Annandale, of the lordship of Galloway, as possessed by Archibald, Duke of Touraine, and Archibald de Douglass his father," according to Wood's Peerage, page 427. But I am sick of dates and learned antiquity, as I can extract no fun out of them; however, I am the devil's own drudge when I set fairly to.</p>

            <p>LINGLE-BACK. Having a long weak back.</p>

            <p>LINKED.-Persons walking arm-in-arm, are said to be linked or huiked.</p>

            <p>LINKS O' PEATS.-Each division of a peal-stack, is called</p>

            <p>a link; so the stack is made up of links.</p>

            <p>LINGED.-Lashed, beaten, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>LINTIE. A linnet; also, a sweet young child.</p>

            <p>LINTSTRAIK.-A head or handful of new-dressed flax.</p>

            <p>LIPPIN-FU'.-Brimming full to the lips.</p>

            <p>LIRK.-A wrinkle, a crevice.</p>

            <p>LITCH.-To strike over.</p>

            <p>LITH. A joint; also, one of those divisions of an orange, or onion, of which they are composed.</p>

            <p>LOANING. A road which has a dyke on either side. LOCHIN BRACK-WELL.-A loch scarcely worth the speaking about, was it not for the famous mineral fountain beside it; the waters of which are of a strong chalybeate nature, good for removing pains in the stomach, and other complaints, which causes it in the proper season to be well attended by invalids; and if there were more houses about it than are, the larger, doubtless, would be the company. The loch answers well for the waterers to fish in, while the moors around are inhabited by grouse, and other moor fowl.</p>

            <p>LOCH SKEROCH.-A large, wild, loch, to the north of Galloway, famous for its scythe sand. This is found on the beach of the lake, and is wrought of grey-stones, in the lake by the waters; it is sold in shops during the mowing season, at about twopence the Scotch pint.</p>

            <p>LODDANS. Small pools of standing water.</p>

            <p>LOGGIE.-A fire in a snug place, or a snug place for a fire. LOGGWATER.-Luke-warm water.</p>

            <p>LOITS.-Those liquid drops, which leap out of pots when they are boiling, and scaud those persons seated round the ingle.</p>

            <pb n="320" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>LONKOR.-A hole built through dykes, to allow sheep to pass. I have no idea where this word is derived from; probably from the same source as loan.</p>

            <p>LOOF-BANE. The centre of the palm of the hand. LOOFIE CHANNLESTANES.-When curling first began, it was played by flat stones, or loofies; these are yet to be found in old lochs.</p>

            <p>LOOFIES.-Plain mittens for the hands.</p>

            <p>LOOT-DOWN. To stoop down.</p>

            <p>LOUP THE BULLOCKS.-A very rustic sort of amusement. Young men go out to a green meadow, and there, ou "all fours," plant themselves in a row about two yards distant from each other. Then he who is stationed farthest back in the "bullock rank" starts up, and leaps over the other bullocks before him, by laying his hands on each of their backs; and when he gets over the last one, leans down himself as before, whilst all the others, in rotation, follow his example; then he starts and leaps again.</p>

            <p>But what makes this fun of a bullock or brutish description, is the severe tumbles the leapers often meet with; for that bullock is considered the most famous of the "herd" that can heave up the "rump" highest and smartest, when the leaper is going over, and can launch him on his nose, to the effusion of his blood on the meadow; yes, much "claret," to use the slang of pugilists has been spilt, and many wrists sprained at this work.</p>

            <p>I have sometimes thought that we have borrowed this "recreation" from our neighbours of the "green isle," as, at their "wakes" they have a "play" much of the same kind, which they seem to enjoy, called "Riding Father Doud." One of the "wakers" takes a stool in his hand, another mounts that one's back; then, "Father Doud" <pb n="321" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA321#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />begins a rearing and plunging, and if he unhorses his rider with a dash, he does well. These Irish wakes must surely be very singular frolics. There is another "play" at them called "kicking the brogue," which is even ruder than "Riding Father Doud;" and a third too, behind neither of them in rustic madness, called "Scuddieloof." These rough concerns originate from a hatred they have at too much melancholy; for, when the parents, or other friends of the deceased, see a person at the "wake" dull, and sitting sorry-like, they get displeased, and will say, "Why came ye here to mourn, for one that's in Heaven?" At these meetings all are made welcome, and a Scotch stranger is adored. Much whisky is drank at them, and plenty of tobacco smoked. Amongst the lower orders of the people there is no scene like a " wake." And to see the relations of the defunct Papist retiring, one by one, now and then, and talking and asking questions at the cold corpse, really bespeaks a terrible ignorance and gross superstition. . If the deceased has left behind a wife, then will she lean over her breathless husband, and go on with her tongue in the following manner, rocking her body to the words she utters :-" And o' Burnie, why are ye gaen to lave me? what harm did I to ye, Barnie? I never struck ye, nor slighted ye; the loom will stand toom now, for the want o' ye, Barnie; and how will I get out the web? and how shall I get turf for the fire, Barnie? O! why man did ye lave me," and so on. Then the daughter Bridget, or the son Morgan, will go and make their wail, perhaps, in a similar manner. But this wailing gets into howling on the day of the funeral: like the natives of some savage nations, they follow the bier, giving out shrieks and howls that are heard miles off. "Oho" is sounded on a thousand different keys. The priests generally attend the funerals of those who die in their parishes, and this attention is for the sake of their purses, as all their "attentions" are. <pb n="322" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA322#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />When they come to a "cross-road," or any thing like a "cross," the corpse is laid down on the ground by the bearers, and set up at "aunclion" by the priest. "And who will give me most for the sake of this man's soul?" will he say. Then one will bid three-pence, another perhaps five-pence, and a third may probably give a penny more, which six-pence his reverence pockets, and tells his poor infatuated followers" that this will help the deceased through purgatory." A corpse has been known to have been " set up" by a priest ten different times on its way to the grave. When the interment of the body is over, the priest returns to the "Burial house," and scares by his words the "spirit" of the deceased away, which is thought to linger behind about the "eazles o' the house," and other strange places. He then regulates the "beads” of the family, puts all the "saints" in order; and if, as before fancied, it has been a man that death has taken away, the priest, for common, passes the night with the widow woman, and trims her " beads" in secret. But, I am falling into my wandering system, digressing a little, to expose strange truths; truths that I have fallen in with while dipping into the manners of the rustic world, and may be firmly depended on to be strictly true. To give the rude manners of Erin fair play, I may some day soon put through the press a small treatise, written about them entirely.</p>

            <p>LOVEANENDIE!-An exclamation, "O! strange." LowE, the Poet-A person about whom a great deal has been written and said, and for what reason I have never rightly known. He is held up as being the best poet that ever sang in Galloway. Far be it from me to take any thing from his character; yet I cannot help saying that I think more notice has been taken of him than he deserves. His whole fame as a poet, rests on the song of "Mary, weep no more for me;" and it is doubtful whether ever he <pb n="323" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA323#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />composed a line of it. I met with an honest man once, who told me "that he knew an old woman who sang it long before Lowe was born." Lowe had the merit, however, of singing and making it popular at his singing schools; and let him be the author or not, still the song has nothing very original about it. There are ten times better songs, the productions of Galloway bards, and not a word about them. However, Fame trump away; stop not one of thy blasts for Lowe, for a wretch like me. LOWNE.-Calm, not windy; be lowne, speak in a low</p>

            <p>voice.</p>

            <p>LOWPING-ON STANES-Stones common about country inns for getting into carts, or mounting horses from. LOWSNESS-A laxness, purging, &amp;c.; "to be fashed wi’ a lowsness," means not to be costive. I have heard of priests preaching themselves into a lowsness, for the sake of saving sinners. Poets, too, rhyme themselves whiles into this state; really men of genius should be wary. LUCE-A blue matter which is scraped off the face in shaving.</p>

            <p>LUCHTER-An handful of corn in the straw; some reapers</p>

            <p>are better than others at rowing luchters; that is to say, better at rolling a neat handful of grain when they cut it. LUCKIE-A canty old woman, neither young, nor dead old.</p>

            <p>YOUR SERVANT BIRKBUSH.</p>

            <p>My dear Lucky Clink, come now alter thy plan,</p>

            <p>Long have I made a most desperate push,</p>

            <p>And a honeyblob ay, unto me ye doth prove,</p>

            <p>Then clasp to thy bosom, Your Servant Birkbush.</p>

            <p>Tho' mine hair now be grey, Lucky, yet I am young,</p>

            <p>As supple as whalebone, as straight as a rush,</p>

            <p>Mine nerves like a youth's about twenty are strung,</p>

            <p>O! but your heart, my kind deary, is warm,</p>

            <p>How lovely ye talk, and can sing like a thrush,</p>

            <p>Was I made of ice, thou hast beauty could charm,</p>

            <p>And make him run mad, Your Servant Birkbush.</p>

            <p>I never yet found ye, sweet Lucky, inclined</p>

            <p>To give me a sneer, mine affections to crush;</p>

            <p>But I always observed, that you fully designed</p>

            <p>To wed sometime soon, Your Servant Birkbush.</p>

            <p>Now ye sit by my side, this is pleasure indeed,</p>

            <p>Now ye give me a kiss, I am all in a flush,</p>

            <p>My pulse moveth now at a cantering speed,</p>

            <p>What enjoyment is this, to Your Servant Birkbush!</p>

            <p>I'm o'erpower'd, scarce another bit thing can I say,</p>

            <p>Lie still then, my tongue, all my gabbling hush,</p>

            <p>To morrow, I'm told, will be my wedding-day,</p>

            <p>Then hoob, cockabendie, Your Servant Birkbush.</p>

            <p>LUCKPENNY-The cash which the seller gives back to the buyer, after the latter has paid him; it is given back with the hope that it may prove a lucky bargain.</p>

            <p>LUCKRASS The name of a cross-grained, cankered, gudewife.</p>

            <p>LUGGIE-The horned owl.</p>

            <p>LUIRING the GRUN-When a farmer starts inthe morning, staff in hand, and collie at his foot, then clambers up one hill and down another, seeing how his cattle are faring, how his labourers are going on, how his crop looks, and how the weather appears-this job is called luiking the grun. If he has taken too much whisky on the marketnight, he throws the spring-wells in his range, while luiking the grun. And though he should leave his wife, sweet soul, by the skreech o' day, she rather out of good humour, and he with a confounded sair head, proceeding from the effects of taking the wee drap; yet after this delightful exercise, he will return full of health and spirits, and meet with his spouse up and bustling amongst the affairs of the household, as busy as a bee, and as happy as the day is long. What wonderful scenes have nature opened up to me whiles, when luiking the grun!</p>

            <p>LUMMING-The weather is said to be lumming when raining thick; a lum o' a day, a very wet day; the rain is just coming lumming down, when it rains fast. word and loom, a mist or fog, are of kindred. LUNIESHOTT-The loin bone gone out of its socket. LUNTING-Walking and smoking a pipe.</p>

            <p>LURDAN-An extremely lazy woman; an abominable female. LUSCAN-A sturdy beggar, and a thief. A luscan was lodged once in a farm-house in the parish of Minniegaff, and thought proper to walk off in the morning with the bed-clothes, which had been given him to sleep in during the night; but he had not long made off with his booty, before he was bewildered in a misty day; so our luscan wandered, and knew not where he was going; he still kept walking on, however, and when evening came, a house appeared in view, so he would go in and seek quarters; but what house was this but the very one he had left in the morning? and what gudewife did he meet but the one he had robbed? The scene dumfounder'd the wretch, and swarf''d him so, that he could not utter a word. LY E-Pasture land about to be tilled; ploughmen talk about the lifting of a tuich lye with as much concern as statesmen do about nations, or astronomers about other worlds.</p>

            <p>LYSE-HAY-Hay mowed off pasture land, and not off meadows; this hay is more difficult to mow than any other kind, for it has what mawsters call a matted sole, which racks the showther-blades in cutting it, and makes the boutings short to a sharp.</p>

            <p>MACDIARMID-John M'Diarmid, Esq. Editor of the "Dumfries and Galloway Courier," a gentleman ́ well <pb n="326" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA326#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />worthy a place in my never-failing Encyclopædia; for ever since he became connected with the south, as a journalist, he has behaved himself like a man of honest genius. He has reported many good original things, and his ears have never been shut to the calls of real merit, for which he is and long will be well liked all over Galloway. The rustic poets around have ever found him leaving a corner to their service, and many have availed themselves of sporting the muse on that esplanade. The most prominent of these have been the Reverend Mr. Gillespy, of Kells, a gentleman surely a very good poet, but just rather too refined for my taste (I am fond of hearing the rude sough of nature). Mr. Malcomson, of Kirkcudbright, has also given us some good verses on Tears and Snawdrops; while Mr. Millar has sung "Mamma, Mamma," very prettily, and the scenery seen from the tap o' Criffle. But the hero of this article is a better poet himself than any of these. Behold his talents directed this way in the early numbers of Blackwood, when he was allowed to be the first orator, except the Ettrick Shepherd, in the forum of Auld Reekie. His Scrap Book, too, evinces that its author knows good composition from bad; while his Life of Cowper, the darling English poet, is a biographical sketch rarely gone beyond, and could not have been written by any but a person of similar taste: such is the honest fact, as felt by me; the world, though, may speak for itself. In dressing up an account of a Rood Fair, a Swollen Nith, a Burns' Anniversary, and such things, our author has great merit; he gives them that natural touch which mightier pencils could not pourtray. He has also been the means of helping forward to notice a merchant in Dumfries, a Mr. M'Vittey, the same person, I suspect, who sang the battle of Dryfe Sands, and who published Tales for the ingle-cheek, a little while ago, which are thought by me to be fair wark. So much then for Mac <pb n="327" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />diarmid, and this much will often be read when he and</p>

            <p>O! the pleasures poets feel,</p>

            <p>When they do ride a sound Pegasus,</p>

            <p>With daring front and nimble heel,</p>

            <p>What hobby-horseman them surpasses?</p>

            <p>A brave Pegasus, that doth scorn</p>

            <p>To tramp the path ere trod by any,</p>

            <p>Even tho' its own should seem forlorn,</p>

            <p>Devoid of sweets and beauties many.</p>

            <p>And will not yield for deserts drear,</p>

            <p>With whirling sand and thorny bramble,</p>

            <p>Will snore through stormy seas 'thout fear,</p>

            <p>And o'er the hugest mountains scramble.</p>

            <p>Nor turn aside for tempests black,</p>

            <p>For savage gales, unpiteous howling,</p>

            <p>Nor for the forest grim put back,</p>

            <p>Tho' bloody tigers round be growling.</p>

            <p>But bear along its rider strange,</p>

            <p>Through worlds where curious tribes are swarming,</p>

            <p>Where scenes delight to hourly change,</p>

            <p>From something wild to something charming.</p>

            <p>Fly, where balloons can never fly,</p>

            <p>Sail, where no ship can sail, nor shallop,</p>

            <p>Fling far behind both earth and sky,</p>

            <p>And through celestial regions gallop.</p>

            <p>So may he sing the glowing song,</p>

            <p>The song that sets the heart a weeping,</p>

            <p>That manly song by nature strong,</p>

            <p>Which never falls a nodding, sleeping.</p>

            <p>But groweth like the summer rose,</p>

            <p>The root being in the human bosom,</p>

            <p>MACTAGGART This is no less a personage than myself, born some twenty-five years ago, at Plunton, in the parish of Borgue, quite beside the auld castle o' Plunton. The Friday night before Kelton-hill fair was the night in which I, gomerall Johnie, first opened my mouth in this wicked world. My father is a farmer, and throughout my pilgrimage on earth, from the cradle till this moment, I have never met with any whom I considered had so much native strength of intellect. Let no man say of me, that I am a creature of ability, for such would be wrong; but <pb n="328" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA328#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />that my worthy parent is, and to a great degree, is right; his father was also a farmer, and my grandfather's grandfather got his head cloven at the brack o' Dunbar, fighting in the Highland army against Oliver Cromwell. The name Mactaggart comes directly from the Gaelic, as all names beginning with Mac do. Mac, a son, and tachart, a priest; signifying, the son of a priest. God knows if there be much of a priest about me. My father rented the farm of Plunton from Murray of Broughton, and this being at the outskirt of the parish, my lot was cast three miles from the parish school. A half-grown boy was therefore brought into the house to teach my sisters and me the A, B, C, for I had then two sisters older than myself; though I was the oldest of the boys. There were eleven of us altogether once, six boys and five girls; but I have lost two dear sisters. Well, this boy taught and lashed us occasionally. I mind of being happy when the harrowing came on, as my father required him to harrow the ploughed land in the sowing season, and not us. A neibouring farmer became partner with my father in this dominie, so one part of the year my sisters and me went to this farmer's house, and were taught along with his family, and they came to us in return. While at this work, coming home one night I tumbled into a peat-hole, and should have been drowned, had not my sisters been with me; they haurl'd me out, and so saved a valuable life from perishing in glaur. At length my sisters were thought strong enough to go to Borgue academy; the teaching boy was set adrift, and I being only six years of age, was allowed to remain happy at home, as not thought able to accompany them. So I ran about and hunted butterflies, built little houses on brae sides, and adorned them with bleached periwinkle shells, brought to me from the shore; I also waded in a burn that ran by beside the house, and peived beardocks. I had no companion but a hoolet; this <pb n="329" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA329#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />was brought me when young from the auld castle; I fed it with mice, but it found the way to an old sooty truff laft, and there caught plenty of mice for itself; one day it came ⚫ down from its reeky habitation, to wash itself, having need enough of that; and while doing so, in a tub by the doorcheek, a cock came the way, and sank his deadly spurs into the scull of my poor hoolet; I mourned about this many a day. At last I was thought fit to go with my sisters to school, and then again 'began my woes; nothing could 1 learn. I was begun to the Latin long before I knew any · thing almost of English; as the order ran in these days, one could not be put to the Latin too young." Of a</p>

            <p>truth then I was put young enough to it, but could learn nothing about it. I was lashed upstairs and downstairs, and was saved, I believe, from dying an unnatural death, by my parents flitting from Lennox Plunton, to the farm of Torrs, in the parish of Kirkcudbright. A country school lay just beside us, we had only a hill to go over to it; the master taught the scholars no Latin; this was a great thing to me; he was quite an easy, soothing teacher, a good counter, and could read and write pretty well. With him I began to learn somewhat. I begat an affection for arithmetic, and was soon the best hand amongst figures in the school, going through all the count-books that came before me, like smoke. In truth, Mr. Caig is an excellent teacher; he gives nature fair play; he lets the * scholars pursue their own inclination, be that what it will. If I have any learning, or any genius about me, to this man am I indebted for their improvement. Had he been a dominie who gave out tasks, who obliged the scholars to learn this, and then that, who made a slave of the mind, when in its tender state, and who valued the feelings nothing, I, Mac, would never have been heard of. I should have crawled about, a mean artificial worm of man's formation, without one spark of nature's fire about me. <pb n="330" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA330#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />Whenever a fox-hunt, a shipwreck, a bonspeil, or such thing happened in the neighbourhood, the school was flung open to all who wished to run and see; and I, for one, seldom stayed behind. Indeed I was looked on as rather a careless boy of my book, speiled heuchs for gull-eggs, and trees for young craws; went a fishing frequently; attended all raffles, tea-drinkings, fairs, and what not. Wherever there were any curious sights to be seen, there was I; nothing would have kept me from them but as I got older I met with fewer novelties. My father, thinking from my habits I was learning but little at the country school, (being fond of reading nothing but ballads and histories, as they came to the house in the wallet of the hawker), sent me to the academy at Kirkcudbright, a distance of four miles; this I had to go and come every day. During winter I could not get to it very regularly, with bad weather; and in spring and harvest, when a throng was about the farm, I had to stay, or rather I was fond to stay, and lend a hand. For all, when the examination came on, I laid all the school below me with the mathematics, and so obtained the premium. Being nothing, however, but a mathematician, the rest of the boys laughed at me; so I would go and learn French. I attended this an hour every day, but could not learn it, because tasks were laid out. I now, in my thirteenth year, took a huff at schools and schoolmasters altogether, leaving them both with disgust. At this my parents were displeased; however, they let me take my own mind of it, and as I now had to work at little jobs about the farm, I soon relished this life not very well either; so I would learn a trade: a mill-wright was thought a good one, and a ship-carpenter, but I would go and bind myself to neither; that of a book-printer pleased me best of any; I wrote to the firm of Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, stating the matter, and my wish to become an apprentice. My letter was never answered. I wrote again to Fairbairn and <pb n="331" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA331#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />Co, in the same city, and to Mr. Jackson, Dumfries, but never received any answer from either, which caused me to grow very dull. It was about this time that I began to feel a melancholy working in on me, which I will never get rid of. I may here mention though, that ever since that night on which my mother told me that there would come a day on which I should die, and be covered up with cold mould in a grave, I have been rather haunted with thought; it gives the young mind a dreadful shock on being first made acquainted with this awful truth. Finding, therefore, myself worsted in getting to be a printer, I consoled myself with my lot, and became extremely bookish inclined; and, as the old song goes</p>

            <p>"I bought and borrowed every where,</p>

            <p>"I studied night and day,</p>

            <p>"Ne'er miss'd what Dean nor Doctor wrote,</p>

            <p>"That happen'd in my way."</p>

            <p>I began to the French again by myself, and soon could translate it, and the Latin too. I got hold of a dictionary and Virgil, and pondered away the long fore-nights. A friend who lived in the neighbourhood had an Encyclopædia Britannica; this I was given whenever I wanted a volume; and I must own I have received no small benefit from this kindness. I gathered ten times more out of that book than I did at the College of Edinburgh; a place to which I started on foot, staff in hand, when in my nineteenth year. Before this time I had taken a ramble through England, had been often in love, had wrote poetry, and the devil knows what. I have rhymed since ever I remember, but I keeped dark. After passing a hard winter in Edinburgh, attending my favourite natural classes, reading from libraries, writing for magazines, and what not, I returned to the rural world in the spring; and the next winter I went back to Edinburgh, but not to attend the College, though that was the apparent motive. I never received any good from attending the University. I was <pb n="332" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA332#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />there told nothing but what I had before gathered. But I am running this sketch too far; let my Edinburgh adventures, my wanderings through Scotland, my learning the engineering, my trip to London, my rebuffs from Fortune, and my receiving them kindly, my finding an independent way of making an honest livelihood with industry, &amp;c. &amp;c. form the subject of another foolish discourse at some future period.</p>

            <p>When I reached my twenty-first year, the following poetic coin my muse cast forth from her mint, inscribed</p>

            <p>Thanks to thee, Death, wi' a' my heart,</p>

            <p>For handing back thy wutter'd dart</p>

Perhaps as well as Hudibras's Mall Cutpurse, or Defoe's Moll Flanders, are <pb n="337" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />to the curious reader; hear the song of Mally Whur</p>

            <p>My jolly Wullie Gurlie.</p>

            <p>MANITOODLIE-An affectionate term which nurses give to male children.</p>

            <p>1.</p>

            <p>MANKIE-An ancient kind of worsted stuff, much glazed, worn by females; where it was manufactured I have not gathered; it could not have been in the Isle of Man. MAPSIE-A pet-sheep, called so from its map, mapping with its lips; young hares are also mapsies.</p>

            <p>MARK nor BURN-The same with hilt nor hair; when one loses any thing and finds it not again, we are said to never see mark nor burn of it again; it is a shepherd's phrase, as he burns the sheep with a red hot iron on the horns and nose, to enable him to know them.</p>

            <p>MARK O' MOUTH-A mark in the mouth, whereby horse, sheep, and other cattle-dealers, know the age of the animal by opening its lips. I believe the mark respects the <pb n="338" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA338#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />number of teeth, as these animals, for a certain number of years, get two new teeth annually; but, when they live beyond a certain period, they lose the mark o' mouth; old maidens are said sometimes to have lost the mark o' mouth, when the rose leaves the cheek, and the snowy breasts, which once seemed like little hills, have melted or shrunk away.</p>

            <p>MARKSTANES-Stones set up on end for marks in the days of yore, that farmers might know the marches of their farms, and lairds the boundaries of their lands; these stones are most common in the moors.</p>

            <p>MAUNT-To speak thick and fast; to have a marr in the</p>

            <p>speech.</p>

            <p>MAUTMAN-A man who makes malt.</p>

            <p>Sometime ago,</p>

            <p>maltmen had always good ale about them, so were merry; hence arose the phrase, 66 as merry's a mautman.” MAWSTER-A mower; a wielder of the scythe. MAW-WAW-A tom-cat's cry when he goes a-courting. MAYNE John Mayne, Esq. part editor and owner of the newspaper called "The Star," a London paper, published every evening. This gentleman is a Gallovidian, and a poet; he is the author of that well-known poem the Sillar Gun, a poem Walter Scott says, is beyond the might of Robert Fergusson, and approaches nearer to Burns than any thing in the Scotch language; this says much for Mr. Mayne's muse. In my opinion, the Sillar Gun is a good rustic poem, though I think the young bard before mentioned the greater poet of the two. He also wrote the sweet song of Logan Braes, a poem named Glasgow; another way of Kirkconnel-lee, different from that of Stewart Luis, the author of Owre the Muir amang the Heather. Mr. M. was bred a printer, is now an old respectable man, with much of the Scotchman's warmth about him, with the soul of genius still glinting in his eye. <pb n="339" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA339#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />It refreshes me very much to get a shake of the hand and a crack from Mr. Mayne, for there is more goodness and originality about him than I can express.</p>

            <p>MEAL-HOGY ETT-A barrel for holding oatmeal.</p>

            <p>MEALOMS-Very dry potatoes, when boiled.</p>

            <p>MEALPOWK and the STRING-Begging accoutrements. MEALSTANES-Rude stones of seventeen and a half pounds weight, used in weighing oatmeal.</p>

            <p>MEG O' MONY FEET-A black hard worm, with many hundred feet, and two feelers before: it is quite common between the stones of old dykes, and suspicious places; its length is generally about three inches, and the bite of it poisonous. Hence it is dreaded by youths; indeed, children have a natural instinct to dread it. For all the number of feet it has, and which has given rise to its name, the motions of it are not quick, and when any way interrupted it coils itself up. There is another sort of worm found in the same kind of places with this, and has a number of feet also, though not so many as the other, yet its movements are much quicker; the colour of this one is grassgreen; it has no name, but may be termed, with propriety methinks, the Scotch centipee, as it is of the same genera with the centipee of the torrid zone.</p>

            <p>MELLGRAVE-A break in a highway; a place requiring the genius of M'Adam, the celebrated roadman, to repair it. In roads which pass through soft countries, mellgraves most prevail; it is said that a horse with its rider once sank in a mellgrave somewhere in Ayrshire, and were never more heard of.</p>

            <p>MELL I'THE SHAFT-A phrase, literally meaning a mell, or maul, or mallet in shaft, but used allegorically thus :— when a person's worldly affairs get disordered, it is said the mell cannot be keeped in the shaft; now, unless the mell be keeped in the shaft, no work can be done. Bills become immoveable, the day and the way cannot be keeped <pb n="340" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA340#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />clear; and when, by struggling, a man is not overset, he is said to have keeped the mell in the shaft, or the soul and body in partnership.</p>

            <p>MERLIE Sandy and sweet; when honey is in this state, it is said to be merlie; when it is beginning to grow this way, it merles; and when it is let go on, it is merling. MERMAID'S PURSE-A beautiful kind of sea-weed box, which is found driven in on the shores, of an oblong shape, that is to say, longer than broad, being about two inches and a half one way, and three the other, with a long spraing or talon stretching out from each corner, as long as the box; it is of a raven-black colour on the outside and sea green within, hoven up in the middle, and open at one end; and, unlike other sea-weed, never found connected together.</p>

            <p>MERRICK-Five large hills or mountains in Galloway; they lay beside one another, and gradually rise, the one a little higher above the other; in the morning and evening the shadows of these hills on the level moors below seem like the fingers of an awful hand; hence the name Merrick, which, in the Gaelic, signifies fingers. How expressive that language must be. O! that I were master of it. MERRY-MEAT-The same with kimmering; the feast at a</p>

            <p>birth.</p>

            <p>MERVADIE-Any fine sweet brittle cake is said to be mercadie; this word, and merlie are someway connected; but as I am such a slim linguist, I cannot see the relationship.</p>

            <p>MICELED-Did eat, somewhat after the way of mice. MID-KIPPLE-That piece of hide which keeps the two sticks of a flail in partnership.</p>

            <p>MIDSE-DAY-Middle of the day; mid-room, a little room between the kitchen and parlor; mids, middle. "There's a gude mids in a' things;" which means, extremes should be avoided.</p>

            <pb n="341" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA341#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>MILKER-A cow that gives much milk. A cow with a : "large udder is not always a good milker; it is said that it is by the head that the cow gives the milk; which means, that if a cow be a great eater, she is also a great milker. MILLAE-The loftiest mountain in the south of Scotland, away by four thousand feet above the level of the sea; seldom doth it doff its cowl of snow in honour of the</p>

            <p>sun.</p>

            <p>MILLBANNOCK-A circular cake of oatmeal, with a hole in the centre; it is generally a foot in diameter, and an inch in thickness; it is baked at mills, and haurned or toasted on the burning seeds of shelled oats, which makes it as brittle as if it had been baked with butter; of course, then, the millbannock is allowed to be the chief of all bannocks. A miller in Wigtonshire once made an enormous one of a boll of meal, as a present to his laird the Earl of Galloway, in hopes that the Earl would give him a down-come of the rent; but instead of doing so, he raised it on him fifty pounds per annum, saying, "that if he could afford to make sic millbannocks to his friends, he could be no way distressed." Poor Dusty then had no other shift than to return to his old shop, with his finger in his mouth, and curse confound the plot o' the millbannock.</p>

            <p>MILL-CLOOSE-The same with mill-trowse. The boxed wood-work which conducts the water into mill wheels. MILLER O' MINNIEIVE-Somewhere in the south of Scotland, a traveller may fall in with (by searching every nook) a village, or, more properly, a clauchan termed Minnieive. Its latitude and longitude have never yet been properly ascertained; a thing, by the bye, much wanted now, as the place is every day getting farther into vogue. It will soon eclipse Ambleside on the lakes, as a hamlet of celebrity; for there is the abode of a miller, with whom, for poetry and a thousand other fine things, no laker can <pb n="342" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA342#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />be compared. Respecting this persónage, none but poets can see or have any dealings, but to them, he keeps not in utter darkness; so I shall just give my readers a peep of him from behind the cloud: and firstly then, his</p>

            <p>COMPARISONS.</p>

            <p>Those bergs of ice which do arise</p>

            <p>In arctic worlds to such a size,</p>

            <p>Surprising travellers so bold,</p>

            <p>Who wander through these realms so cold;</p>

            <p>Remind me, by their strange narration,</p>

            <p>Of this vast debt which damns our nation;</p>

            <p>Like it, they higher, wilder rear</p>

            <p>Their awful heads from year to year.</p>

            <p>Each winter's frost and fall of snow</p>

            <p>Do make them swell, and larger grow,</p>

            <p>Just as the interest doth the sum,</p>

            <p>And foolish broils with sword and drum.</p>

            <p>Till now 'tis got so mighty big,</p>

            <p>It frights the tory and the whig;</p>

            <p>Few find their souls sufficient bold,</p>

            <p>As can the monster huge behold;</p>

            <p>None but philosophers must dare,</p>

            <p>And poets, who are free of care.</p>

            <p>No taxes that reduce are felt,</p>

            <p>No suns the dreadful mount will melt;</p>

            <p>"Twill tower away yet for awhile,</p>

            <p>Ascend yet farther two, three mile,</p>

            <p>Then down 'twill tumble with a dash,</p>

            <p>And who, good God, will stand the crash?</p>

            <p>So much then for the Miller; his comparisons are worth</p>

            <p>the looking at. Mark another :—</p>

            <p>Squire Kirtle's worth ten thousand pounds,</p>

            <p>And more than that the squire's a villain,</p>

            <p>Bob Keel has neither cash nor grounds,</p>

            <p>And yet the lad is worth a million.</p>

            <p>How comes this, let's see the plan?</p>

            <p>"Tis very plain, you need not doubt it,</p>

            <p>Bob Keel is just an honest man,</p>

            <p>So that is all there is about it.</p>

            <p>At this, Squire Kirtle now may itch,</p>

            <p>May roup his farmers, try stock-jobbing,</p>

            <p>Do all he can to be as rich,</p>

            <p>And yet he'll ne'er come up wi' Robbin.</p>

            <p>Squire Kirtle with his hounds and whores,</p>

            <p>And all the luxuries of folly,</p>

            <p>Are smother'd quite by Robbin's stores,</p>

            <p>And what are they?a kent and collie.</p>

            <pb n="343" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA343#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>Squire Kirtle lolls on sofas soft,</p>

            <p>When he with wine gets swell'd and groggy,</p>

            <p>But poor Bob Keel reposeth oft</p>

            <p>By cauller springs on banks sae foggy.</p>

            <p>Which now, is the better man?</p>

            <p>The one is hemlock-t'other myrtle,</p>

            <p>We need not guess, we see the plan,</p>

            <p>Bob Keel is far before Squire Kirtle.</p>

            <p>An honest man's the king of men;</p>

            <p>If heaven hath good and better places,</p>

            <p>The best place there some yet may ken,</p>

            <p>Is, where the soul that's honest graces.</p>

            <p>For the sake of fun I may give another, and the most singular of the three:</p>

            <p>Whar yon burn frae Kirrbride</p>

            <p>Tammles into the sea,</p>

            <p>Twa hizzies abide,</p>

            <p>The first for her sourness,</p>

            <p>They are baith named Jeanie,</p>

            <p>And her hide's like a guinea:</p>

            <p>O lord! she is yellow,</p>

            <p>And yawps like a peany,</p>

            <p>But the tither is mellow,</p>

            <p>O, she is my Jeanie.</p>

            <p>In my arms she will lie,</p>

            <p>I weep for thee, Mary, my lovely dear,</p>

            <p>But the surges care not for me,</p>

            <p>The billows do not my wailing hear,</p>

            <p>My soul is in sorrow for thee;</p>

            <p>My poverty did force us to part,</p>

            <p>MILL-LADE. The drain or lead, as it were, which conveys the water from mill-dams to the mill-wheel; sometimes called mill-race.</p>

            <p>MILL-SHILLING.-The shelled grain, which runs out of the mill-e'e. When we see a person vomiting, from the effects of drinking spirits, we say he was "sendin' the driuk frae him like a mill-shilling."</p>

            <p>MIM-MOU'D. Having an affected way of speaking. MINNIEGAFF. One of the wildest Moorland parishes in Galloway; some of the natives of it live fifteen miles from church; this was the parish wherein was born and bred, <pb n="346" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA346#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />our celebrated linguist Murray. The following love song, respecting this bleak tract, somewhat pleases me—</p>

            <p>My Mary dear's awa’</p>

            <p>My sweet love's awa',</p>

            <p>And left me in this weary warl,</p>

            <p>MISERTISH. Having the manners of a miser; being avaricious.</p>

            <p>MISSLIE. We say such a one is misslie, when his presence is missed any where, and thought to be a wanting. MITELED.-Eaten away, as if with mites.

            <p>THE MOOR MINISTER.</p>

            <p>While on his feet he has a pair o' elogs,</p>

            <p>For plunging mang the saft and spouty bogs,</p>

            <p>Nor does he wi' them gie a clamping elink,</p>

            <p>Fa' weel he tells his modest tale without it,</p>

            <p>MORN-I'E-MORNING.-The morn after light dawns forth. Morning begins when twelve o'clock at night is run; but the morn-i'e-morning, in the dead of winter, begins not until near eight o'clock. It is a singularly expressive phrase, the morn on the morn, and far from being the same with the morrow-morning; that is the morning of another day spoken of, whereas this relates to one and the same morning.</p>

            <p>MORROCH.-TO soil any thing. When any thing is trampled in a gutter, we say it is morroch'd; probably this and gorroch, is one and the same word as to derivation, but different as to meaning.</p>

            <p>MORTH O' CAULD.-Those who receive a severe cold, get what is termed their morth o' cauld; which means, their death from cold, (from Latin mors, death; or mort, deadly.) MOSHIN-HOLE.-The touch-hole of a piece of ordnance; "pike the moshin-hole," say we, to those who are for firing a gun, when, on being snap'd, it burns priming; which means, to clean out the touch-hole.</p>

            <p>rivers.</p>

            <p>MOSS-HAGGS. Any break in black-looking, wild, mossy moors, is called a hagg.</p>

            <p>MOWDIE-HILLANS.-Mole-hills; in the large ones, the animals have their nests, there they breed the young mowdiewarts. MOWDIEMEN.-Mole catchers, from mowdie, a mole. These men are generally all from Westmorland, and commonly very singular characters. My friend John Rook is the most celebrated in this way. John is truly a wonderful, shrewd, good-natured fellow; his observations are all original, and his tales, jokes, &amp;c. with the manner in which he tells them, have made me laugh a thousand times.</p>

            <p>MOYLIE.-A mild, good-natured person; an auld moylie, a tame person, even to sillyness; a moylie, is also a bullock wanting horns.</p>

            <p>-</p>

            <p>MOZIE. A moidert-looking person; a being with silly intellects.</p>

            <p>MUCKLE-CHAIR.-The large arm-chair, common in all houses, whose inmates revere the memory of their forefathers; for farther knowledge respecting this rustic throne, peep at the following poem :</p>

            <p>MUGG. To strike or buck a ball out from a wall, as is</p>

            <p>done in the game of the wa'baw.</p>

            <p>MUGG-SHEEP-Sheep all white-coloured; lowland sheep. MUGGART. The mugwort; out of these boys make blowch</p>

            <p>tons.</p>

            <p>MULDERT.-Mouldered, rotted, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>MUMPLE. To seem as if going to vomit.</p>

            <p>MUNN. An old person with a very little face; see Cuttymun, and since writing that article, Cuttymuns and three Laddles, have come into my head; so this phrase may seem to say, that Cuttymun is a short-shanked spoon. MUNNONDAY.-The ancient way of naming Monday. MUREBURN. The way they have in the moorlands, of burning down the old heather, so that grass may arise to feed cattle and sheep. The heather is never allowed by <pb n="354" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA354#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />good farmers to grow more than four or five years. The work of mureburn goes on in the dry weather of spring, and blazes away with a rapid wildness, frightning hares and grouse from its neighbourhood. When viewed from the Lowlands on a fine night, it makes one fancy of the devastations of war, spreading so quickly when lighted, and encircling the wild mountains in red flaming curves. It must also somewhat resemble that scene seen by some travellers in foreign countries, of forests set in flames by the natives to destroy serpents, and scare away wild beasts. When any thing like bad news spreads fast, we say, "it goes like mureburn."</p>

            <p>MURE-ILL. A disorder common among cattle, and thought to proceed from the animals eating poisonous herbs; it is somewhat cured with doses of salts and saltpetre. Nowt taen to a new gang, or nowt, after a spate, are apt to take the mure-ill or red-water; it also prevails much with cattle which graze on a moor pasture; hence the name mure-ill, or the ill of the moor.</p>

            <p>MURRAY, the Historian.-Mr. Murray, a gentleman who</p>

            <p>lately published the Literary History of Galloway, a work he has certainly done much justice to; and I only think it a pity, that he paid so much attention to a subject, not surely worth the paying attention to. For instance, what was the use of rummaging ancient libraries, to know whether a certain priest once lived in a certain parish, and a priest who, when all is known of him that can be or could be, is worth nothing, he turns out to be a mere common priest? Mr. M. is also too in an error, when he thinks that there are, or have been, no literary characters in Galloway but priests; however, the industry of this author I laud, and long to see directed to something of more consequence; perhaps I may take this home to myself.</p>

            <p>MURRAY, the Linguist.-Dr. Murray, the celebrated</p>

            <p>linguist, and author, born in Minniegaff, died in Edin<pb n="355" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA355#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />burgh, &amp;c. &amp;c. I have only one remark to make on him, and I have done. Why has he not given the world something respecting his native language, his mother tongue? did he look down on, and despise it? this I cannot think, for he was a lover of his country: yet I cannot help thinking that the Gallovidians are as good a tribe of human beings as any in the neighbourhood of Gondar, and as much worthy attention. It will be some time, in my opinion, ere a native of Senaar, returns the compliment to the Doctor's country which he has done to his. Had he clubbed his skill in the Scotch language to that of Dr. Jamieson, how much would Scotland have praised his name! What he has done, however, is well enough, and had his life been spared, we might have expected more. He has travelled with Bruce to the source of Nilus, as arduous a task as his name-sake Bruce had in establishing the independence of Scotland. Murray has shewn himself to be a creature of strong intellect, and unabating perseverance; view him in any light we will, we discover a wonderful prodigy.</p>

            <p>MURRLIN. A very froward child, ever whining and illnatured.</p>

            <p>MUSH. A vast of matters tossed together, such as straw, grain, hay, chaff, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>MUSHOCH. A heap of grain, thrashed out and laid aside in a corner for seed; this grain is confined into as small a bulk as possible, by surrounding it with mushoch-rapes, thick ropes twisted on purpose.</p>

            <p>MUSSLE-BROSE.- -A brose made from muscles. These shell-fish are boiled in their own sap, and this juice, when warm, is mingled with oatmeal; so a strong brose indeed is made, perhaps the strongest that can be; for it is</p>

            <p>A dish by Jove might feast a king,</p>

            <p>MUTTYOCH'D or MOTTYOCH'D.-Matted; when sheaves of corn grow together, after being cut in moist weather, we say they are muttyoch'd, or matted together.</p>

            <p>NAB-A blow on the head.</p>

            <p>NABBLE-A narrow-minded, greedy, laborious person. NACKIE-A person expert at any art is said to be nacky. NACKUZ-One who tells a tale pretty sharply; sometimes naxie is the word.</p>

            <p>NAELSTRING-The umbilical cord.</p>

            <p>NAGGS-Large pegs for hanging things out of the way on. NAIL'D-Knocked over. Thus we say when we see a hare</p>

            <p>Our names for</p>

            <p>shot, that she's nail'd; also a villain caught at his tricks, is nail'd; and a girl when she gets pregnant of a spurious child, is said to be nail'd: the term is applied various ways, and may literally mean fixed as with a nait. NAMES O' GRUNS-Names of farms. farms, like our names for various other things, are somewhat strange; a few of the derivations of them may be traced by good Celtic scholars to that ancient language, others to tongues of a like nature. Thus all those beginning with Auchen, Drum, Nock, &amp;c. we may easily expound; but it would require a dab, methinks, in the Gaelic, to know the true meaning of Orhars, Mollock, Killiemingie, Nabeny, and Airds, we know, stands for rocks; Torrs, for wet rocky land; Senwicks, for sandwicks, or sandy bays; Granges, for garnels or barns, &amp;c. In every parish there are generally two farms, the <pb n="357" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA357#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />one named Boreland, the other Ingleston; how these are so named, antiquarians differ; but as to those which have burn, glen, cleuch, or any such natural objects in their names, we see through them at once. Moorland farms, too, differ much from those of the dale, with respect to the character of their names; they seem to be of a wilder and outlandish nature. In Wigtonshire a cluster of moorfarms lie together, unable amongst them all to grow a boll of corn. I never hear their names mentioned but they make me laugh-Pultidee, Dirniemow, Glenkitten, Glenwhully, Muirdow, Craigbirnoch, the Quarter and the Close. There are many in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, too, which amuse the ear, such as Clauchendolly, Cullkeggerie, Barrcheskie, &amp;c. People fond of flinging every thing into rhyme, often fling the names of a number of farms so for fun, but none of these I have heard comes up with the Ayrshire one on this subject:</p>

            <p>"Doughtie, Auchengairn, Dawine, and Dahairn,</p>

            <p>"Clasgalloch, the Balloch, the Challoch,</p>

            <p>"The Chang, and the Cairn."</p>

            <p>These farms are all lying round the celebrated Steps o' Styncher, on the way from Maybole to Newtonstewart, by the famous Nick o' the Balloch way from Ayrshire to Galloway (not by the way of the famed Laird o' the Knows.) The Chang is the Gaelic, I believe, for a tongue, and the Nick o' the Balloch, means a nick, a hollow pass through moors, from which a great balloch or moor view is to be had; indeed, a great part of both Ayrshire and Galloway is seen from this place. It is not long since some families lived in Galloway, who spoke Gaelic; so it will be found, the greater part of the names of farms, waters, parishes, &amp;c. come from that language; thus, Cree is a march, a boundary, &amp;c.; Ken, the chief; Kenmore, the chief head. But why treat of this farther?</p>

            <p>NANSE The name for Agnes, or Nannie, or Nancy;</p>

            <p>a lovely lass of this name gave cause for the following</p>

            <p>song</p>

            <p>NANCY GREENWOOD.</p>

            <p>Farewell, say I, to learning</p>

            <p>To dungeon studies, dark and deep,</p>

            <p>My heart is set a-yearning,</p>

            <p>I'm out of trim, I cannot sleep;</p>

            <p>And all for Nancy Greenwood,</p>

            <p>Charming cheeked rosy queen,</p>

            <p>I ne'er thought to've been this way,</p>

            <p>Is whirling all as wild's the wind,</p>

            <p>Algebra gives me pain now,</p>

            <p>And nought with Fluxions I can find;</p>

            <p>But lovely Nancy Greenwood,</p>

            <p>Standing fair within my sight,</p>

            <p>Sweet soul, she's all I now see,</p>

            <p>And all I care for in the light.</p>

            <p>With rapture oft I've gazed</p>

            <p>Upon the sun, the moon, and stars,</p>

            <p>But now my eyes are glazed,</p>

            <p>My passions all run to the wars;</p>

            <p>'Bout smiling Nancy Greenwood,</p>

            <p>Eclipsing deary, fair and free,</p>

            <p>Shut up thy treasures, nature,</p>

            <p>I want no other gem from thee.</p>

            <p>And let me climb that hill there,</p>

            <p>Or rove along the roaring shore,</p>

            <p>My heart finds Nancy still there,</p>

            <p>And will, I fear, for evermore;</p>

            <p>"Tis full of Nancy Greenwood,</p>

            <p>The pain is heaven to endure;</p>

            <p>Disorders are delightful,</p>

            <p>When love is both the cause and cure,</p>

            <p>So sweet she comes before me,</p>

            <p>Shining like the solar beam,</p>

            <p>That phantom would restore me,</p>

            <p>But ah! that phantom is a dream;</p>

            <p>My darling Nancy Greenwood,</p>

            <p>Cares nothing for the rural boy,</p>

            <p>As Nancy is a lady,</p>

            <p>So I must love, but ne'er enjoy.</p>

            <p>NAPPLEROOT-The black knotty root of an herb, diligently digged for and greedily chewed by boys; its taste being rather pleasant.</p>

            <p>NAPSIE-A fat little animal, such as a sheep,</p>

            <p>NATHAN MACKIE-A very celebrated original Gallovidian priest and poet; his song of "Jeamie, the glory and pride o' Dee," is very natural, and sweetly sung; he was a most eccentric character, went about home very roughly clad; his hair, which was black, stood right on end; and in an old song wrote on him, a verse hints at this:</p>

            <p>-</p>

            <p>He gat na't frae his minnie, O!</p>

            <p>Nor yet frae his daddie,</p>

            <p>Some craddle fright, or some anld wight,</p>

            <p>Did swarf the young Mackie laddie.</p>

            <p>He was a great fisher, and extremely charitable. In the water of Dee he would wade for days together, and fish for geds; few beggars ever came the way of his manse, but he gave them quarters. An old carle called on him one evening, and seeing the reverend gentleman in the nuik, and not very divinely clad, the beggar fancied that this was a personage like himself, but who had been more fortunate in getting the snug birth before him; so he turned on his heel, and walked away, saying "hech how, my room's taen up!" when the priest spoke out, and bade him " come away and reestle himself at the ingle-cheek;" which the card gladly obeyed. The anecdotes of Nathan are many, some of which will appear in the course of this work. A few specimens of his poetry I may give, thought to be his :</p>

            <p>O! I shall follow no man's way,</p>

            <p>Nor shall I imitate a manner,</p>

            <p>The best may often go astray,</p>

            <p>Tho' marching under virtue's banner.</p>

            <p>Would some kind spirit let me know</p>

            <p>This curious mystic, I'd like well,</p>

            <p>Which are the creatures here below</p>

            <p>Will go to Heaven, and which to Hell?</p>

            <p>Then I'd be sensible which best</p>

            <p>"Twould be for me to follow close,</p>

            <p>To shun the damned, and love the blest,</p>

            <p>Tho' they were hedged by many foes.</p>

            <p>But none will this me e'er inform,</p>

            <p>Yet Christ has pointed out the way,</p>

            <p>Which I shall walk, and fear no storm,</p>

            <p>With hopes to hail the eternal day.</p>

            <p>NATURALLS-Human beings who want a part of the mind that seemingly they ought to have; who move about, as it were, purely by the dictates of nature; such creatures are common in all countries, and attract the attention of men by their wild and out-of-the-way eccentricities. In Galloway there are and have been not a few of them; and I have often pleased myself in admiring their ways. Davie Eddie is one of the chiefs of this band; he hotters about the clauchans, and a troop of boys in his train, dancing to wandering fiddlers, and street bagpipe players. Wull Gourlay runs about the country, plays tunes on his nose, by making sound come through it, and touching the sides with his finger, so produces sneeling notes. He is also fond of eating sclaters; he puts the insects on his tongue, and, like the Ant-bear, lets them travel down his red gullet. Sawny Clarnoch, the doil'd New Galloway herd; there is something poetical in this naturall; he wanders by lonely shores, wild woods, and the tops of mountains, standing frequently and pondering; he is extremely modest, and would die, I dare say, before he would beg a bit; he runs barefoot, and attends country kirks on Sundays. Jamie Neilson is a droll soul, and every thing with him is either the plan or not the plan. Thus peelocks and buttermilk's the plan; porridge in a barn is not the <pb n="362" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA362#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />plan.

            <p>Many act the naturall who are not so; they play the character for the sake of deception. Johnie Girr, of Auchencairn, was famous at this; in his young days, he was one of the greatest smugglers on the shores of the Solway, and outwitted the most sagacious kingsmen. Once while driving from the Isle of Man, with his little wherry pretty full of contraband goods, he was seen by a revenue cutter, who gave him chase. When Johnie saw this, he hove his barrels overside, fixed to a thick rope, and sank them; afterwards he took his seat at the helm, and bade the boy who sailed with him "go into the fore-scuttle and lie down." The cutter came snoring and firing, but our smuggler sat still in his auld sea coat, and never seemed to mind her; at length the revenue tars brought their row barge alongside, and damn'd our hero, saying, what " hindered to haul his wind and lie to, when he saw them playing away upon him?" " Gude guide us, (quoth Johnie, with a great deal of seeming ignorance) if I had ken'd it was me ye war firing at, I wad hae been terrible fleyd;" which <pb n="363" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA363#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />answer, and seeing nothing but a stupid looking old man aboard, convinced the kingsmen that John was doing, or could do nothing in the smuggling trade. Gude guide us! was always his favourite exclamation, and he gave it with such a mystic gravity of face, that the most serious could not help laughing at him. NEB O' THE MORNING-That part of the day between day-light and sun-rising, or sun-light; the neb or nose of an animal being its front member, so this part of the day, being its front part, is termed the neb also; now the neb of any animal is commonly its coldest member, the beak of the morning is the coldest space of the day. And there are few who do not love to keep the bed until the neb gangs aff the morning; the coldest time, in cold weather, is always this time before sun-rise; it is when the neb is on the morning that the hoar-frost is produced. NEDEUM-A gnawing pain; when a corn is biting a toe grievously, that toe is said to be nedeuming; when a person considers himself injured by the world, and is seen to shun society, foster melancholy and misanthropic feelings, that being is said to have a nedeum gnawing his inwards; when he is heard to curse `and utter wicked imprecations to himself, he is then nedeuming.</p>

            <p>NEERS-The kidneys of animals; neer-strings, those strings which are connected with the kidneys.</p>

            <p>O! AY!-O yes.</p>

            <p>OBERING. A hint; an inkling of something important, yet thought a secret. "I gat the obering o' a wadding that's to happen soon;" means, I got hint of such like, in a crafty way.</p>

            <p>ОнO! An exclamation of joy, or rather a joyous assent to the truth of a tale a telling; thus, if it is said that such a one has got haud o' a rich hizzie for a wife, "Oho! faith, that cheel has done weel," is the answer. OoZLIE.-A person is said to be oozlie looking, when he has on a long beard, unbrushed clothes, and dirty shoes, as is the case with those who love the "late debauch." ORISHEN.-A term of reproach, for a savage-behaved individual; probably this word is from the French ourson, a bear's cub.</p>

            <p>OSHEN. A mean person; from the French oison, a ninny.</p>

            <p>OUNCLE-WEIGHTS.-A general sweeping name for all the weights that are used about farm-houses, for the purposes of weighing; these weights are generally sea-stones of various sizes, regulated to some standard. And the Galloway folks have been long famed for giving downweights, or something more than enough, of any thing they either sell by weight or measure. I once heard a tolerable joke respecting this. A person came to an honest gude wife, and wanted a pun o'butter, but, as bad luck would have it, the punstane was lost, so she did not know how in all the world she should serve her customer; the ouncle-weights were rummaged over and over, and none less than the mealstone quarter could be found, and with this she saw it was impossible to weigh a pound; while pondering the matter as a gude wife ponders, the tangs (tongs) struck her fancy. "O! (quo she) I ken how we'll manage now; the gude man brought hame a pair o' new tangs the ither night, which weighed in the smiddy just twapun; sae stand by and I'll soon weigh ye wi' them your butter." She then opened the legs of the tongs, put one leg in the scale against the butter, and let the other hang out. The beam got its fair swing, and so weighed a douce Galloway pound of butter.</p>

            <p>OUTCA. A wedding feast given by the master to a favourite</p>

            <p>OWLING.-Looking like an owl.</p>

            <p>OWRE BOGGIE.-People are said to be married in an owre boggie manner, or to have an owrie boggie wedding when they do not go through the regular forms prescribed by the national kirk. There is some sweetness, I should think, and gallantry felt in weddings of this kind; there is something glorious in a trip to Gretna Green with a lovely lady: staying and getting quietly noosed at home is no workI relish the owre boggie system. Those who plot in secret are called auld boggie fowk; and displaced priests, who used to bind people contrary to the canon laws, though agreeably to nature's, were designated auld boggies. There was an ancient song, I believe, of the name of Owre Boggie, burned at Edinburgh in the turbulent times; this song is lost, so think the antiquaries.</p>

            <p>OWRGAUN RAPES.-Ropes put over stacks to hold down</p>

            <p>the thatch; the vertical ropes into which are wove the bridlers, or those which run horizontal.</p>

            <p>OWRIM AND OWRIM.-When a bandwun o' shearers meet</p>

            <p>with a flat of growing grain, not portioned out to them by riggs, the shearing of this is termed an owrim and owrim shear, or over-him and over-him. It is a bad plan of reaping, as when the reapers have not equal shares, some will work and some not; some take more than they should, others not so much. A fellow from Green Erin thus exclaimed once against this mode-" Hoh! botheration, rigim and rigim was a pleasant shear, but owrim and owrim was the devil; but Barney can do any thing <pb n="370" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" /> sweet and azy.

            <p>OWRTER.-Farther over. Lye owrter, lie farther over. OWRWALES.-The refuse of any thing selected; the goats, when the sheep are taken away.</p>

            <p>OXTER.-The arm-pit; also to walk arm in arm. Oxtering alang, walking away arm in arm.</p>

            <p>OXTERLEE.-An old fellow of an extremely crabbit nature, who once lived at this place in Galloway; he unluckily was a weaver, a trade that by no means agrees with a bad temper; when a thread would have at any time broke, he would leap down through the web with his feet. The wretch also loved drink, and to beat his wife when he was intoxicated; while going home from the alehouse once, he was heard saying to himself, " If she's gane lye I'll lick her; and if she be up, I'll lick her," viz. his poor wife. Mercy on us, this was giving her no chance for life!</p>

            <p>common as</p>

            <p>"Roll away,</p>

            <p>OYEZ!-Hear ye! The word is from the French oyez; old imperative of the verb ouir, to hear. It is used in France as a call to attention, before proclamations are read in public places; anciently it was used in our country for the same purpose. Oyez, and sometimes a-oyez, was heard sounding at fairs, as sport away, and be handy," is at this day by Irish flingsticks and wheel o' fortune sharpers; at present, old men use it after mentioning things of consequence, as "my son gat a rich wife, oyze."-" The fallow's worth siller, oyze."—" It's a gude farm, oyze," and so forth.</p>

            <p>PADDLED ROUNALL.-In large fields where great flocks of oxen graze together, they have places where they often assemble and seem to amuse themselves, following each other round and round, like boyant bodies in an aquatic vortex. The cause for these animals thus employing themselves at intervals, I have never learned; it proceeds neither from heat, nor from troublesome insects. The brute creation often astonishes man with scenes which seem full of sense; this is instinct but what I have been here speaking about surprises him with a mystical something he cannot describe. These circular spots then shorn of grass are termed paddled rounalls.</p>

            <p>PADDOCK.-A small farm; also a machine shaped like a frog, for carrying large stones.</p>

            <p>PADD-SADDLE.-A soft seat for females to ride on horseback behind their husbands.</p>

            <p>PADJELL.—An old veteran pedestrian; one who has often beat at foot races-these races were once very common in Galloway. A servant of Lord Kenmore beat the whole country at running for years. The night previous to a New Galloway fair, his lordship sent his man away to Edinburgh on an errand, that he might be out of the way, and not shame the fair for a season with his swiftness; off went the fellow, but returned in time to run and gain the prize as usual, though he had run 180 miles in twenty-four hours just before it. Prior to the invention of post offices, all lords and barons had their couriers, and this fellow must have been a fleet one.</p>

            <p>PAINCHES. The paunches of animals-the guts. PAISING. Weighing any thing by the feel of the handpoising. PALACE-TREE.-The place in Galloway, near the village of Gatehouse, whereon stood a palace in the days of yore; a deep ditch surrounds a level space containing about two acres on this stands the ruined edifice; over this <pb n="372" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA372#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />ditch, which is about thirty feet, and filled with water, a draw bridge yet remains in perfection. This palace is thought to have belonged to our olden Scotch kings; and suited them for a Holyrood, when in the southern parts of the dominion.</p>

            <p>PAP. To let any thing fall lightly, is to let it pap.</p>

            <p>PAPPLE.-A noxious seed which grows amongst wheat: extremely prolific.</p>

            <p>PAPPLE, THE SPEAVER.-On my life, I cannot pass this original in silence, for few men would I rather spend an hour with than Mr. Papple, the speater; he personally knows almost every one in the south of Scotland, and is deeply acquainted with the manners of his native country; he seems as if he had gone up and down the interior of the bosoms of men with a lantern and candle, and seen all the hidden springs of the mysterious mind. He goes regularly round the country, castrating and keeping the brute creation in order; all news hears he, and what he hears never forgets: methinks he has all by heart that he has heard these fifty years; ask him of any particular respecting his country, either of one thing or another, and if he knows nothing about it, it is strange. When at home, he is to be found at New Galloway; but he has a home every where in the country, and had I a house, that should also be one of his homes; there might he dawner in on an evening, lay by clicky on the press head, throw off his laggans, draw into the ingle, take tea, toddy, what not, with the utmost comfort; then to the pipe, and crack how folk in moor countries were doing, and how the famous and worthy Provost o' New Galloway was coming on; how sheep smear'd and sold; how Shiel, honest man, did; and my friend Dr. Trotter, if writing any good tales, or if Barbour had any thing ready for the press; how Kenmore was doing, and how the Miss Dayells were looking; if the Lammas spate made the brig totter; or <pb n="373" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA373#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />if the tip premium was good, and whether Manson had any old brandy; such and such things would be through hands, before Mr. P. and me would part; aye, and five hundred things more, which have not been dreamt of.

            <p>PASPER-Samphire. When taken and eat green from the heuchs, makes persons as hungry as a hawk, consequently a healthy herb; it is not easily obtained in some places, no more than it is on Dover Cliffs.</p>

            <p>PAT AND PLAIN.-A downright honest way of speaking. PAUL JONES, the Pirate.-The late celebrated sea robber; a Gallovidian, I am rather sorry to say, but he was a clever devil, had strong talents of the infernal stamp; he was a short thick little fellow, about five feet eight in height, of a dark swarthy complexion. Now I am going to say somewhat of this fellow, and all I say I think is truth, for I have it from the lips of many who : personally knew him, and all about his singular ways. He was a common sailor for several years, out of the port of Kirkcudbright, and was allowed to be unmatched on that coast for skill in sea matters; he was a pilot of the first kind, was quick at conception, and a prophet at foretelling the coming of storms; and when tempests might catch the bark he was in, he dreaded them not, but, like Falconer's Rodmand, was</p>

            <p>"First in action-in retreat the last."</p>

            <p>Yet, though a famous seaman, his mess-mates generally disliked him; he was of a quick, fiery temper, and of a mad, ambitious, aspiring nature; and when roused, he cared not what he did, but would have knocked down all who came in his way, with the first weapon he fell in with; a capstern-bar was his favourite cudjell, and once being beset with a press-gang, in Liverpool, he laid three dead <pb n="374" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA374#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />on the deck, and dashed the rest overside his sloop, into the Salthouse Dock. Having got the command of a pretty large vessel belonging to Kircudbright, he set sail with her. to America, for a cargo of tobacco; while crossing the wide Atlantic, one of the crew, a young lad of fair promise, having some how or other irritated him, the devilish monster ran to a pot of pitch boiling on the deck, and flang a ladle-full of the horrid fluid about the youth, who, in desperation with the pain, leaped overboard, into the gulf stream, and was seen no more. The Earl of Selkirk, hearing of this diabolical act of Paul Jones, threatened, that if ever he came back to the country, he -should receive his reward in punishment for the same. Such news reaching the horrid captain, as he lay with his ship off Long Island, New York, gave him the first hint of changing his mode of life; having got a crew he could depend on in every inferual enterprize, and having (turned such as did not suit him adrift, he steered out a pirate, bent on bloody deeds, scouring the ocean in all directions, and taking prizes and property to great amount; it was now neck or nothing with him, so he brought his mighty talents fairly into action. Ships of all nations dreaded him; the name of Paul Jones struck terror into thousands, and he was frequently thought, like Crumwhull's gib cat, to be where he was not. Having captured, at one time and another, a large fleet, he became quite a piratic Commodore, and was more severe on Britain than on any other nation, and most favourable to the French; the latter soon becoming acquainted with this kindness, offered him one of their highest naval situations, which was channel pilot, the which he accepted, and became a great favourite at the court of France. It was just about this stage of his career, that he made his attack upon Auld Scotland, to be revenged on the Earl of Selkirk, for his threat towards him. He brought his fine ship of war, the Serapis, to an anchor, at the mouth <pb n="375" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA375#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />of his native river Dee, one beautiful summer morning, about forty-five years ago, and sent his barge, manned and armed, to St. Mary's Isle, for the purpose of catching his Lordship, who luckily was not at home that day. After surrounding the mansion, and making search, the pirates came off disappointed, but took the family silver plate with them, the which they, after a time, returned, accompanying the same with a singular letter, in which was notified, that if his lordship had been with him, after he left the Dee, he would have witnessed a fine sea-fight between him and the Ranger, British frigate: this was a severe bout; the pirates beat her off, but did not follow up their capture. What he would have done with his lordship had he caught him, has been a question; it is thought that he would ransomed him for the value of his estate, and so caused his utter ruin. Before arriving at the Dee, he had called at Whitehaven, a town that had once huffed him, and having spiked the cannons on the battery there, he attempted to set the place on fire, but the houses being all of free-stone, he could not get it to blaze so well as he wished; such traits, in the character of Paul Jones, prove him a being of an hellish disposition; for those men of a revengeful nature, are evidently the most horrid wretches on earth. Having rounded Scotland, and visited the Firth of Forth, he returned to Brest-attended on the French navy, and had them frequently on the point almost of starting to the invasion of Britain; falling sick, however, he retired to Paris, or somewhere in its neighbourhood, where he died, a young man rather, not fifty years of age; he died very rich, and all his gold went to the French treasury; whether any of his heirs in GalloHe was the way, could come at any of this, I know not. father of a natural son, by a married lady, the which son yet lives, but is ratherly a doyloch. Paul Jones seems to be unrivalled as a pirate; his undaunted courage, his <pb n="376" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA376#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />penetrating judgment, and bis savage temper, befitted him in an extraordinary manner for the damnable trade. is laughable to look back at the sensation he caused amongst the rural bodies of Galloway, when he brought his ship upon their lonely shores; some armed themselves with scythes, some with pitch-forks, old guns too were looked at, while many fled and hid themselves in Rossens o' whuns, caves, and wild mosses. A row-boat went down the river heavily armed, the evening he stood out to sea, for the purpose of intercepting him with their tale of it, if he dared to return; when this boat came in sight of the Oyster Craig, it was thought to be Paul Jones's armed barge, so a heavy firing was opened on it, and as the tide was filling, the rock in time became covered with water, so the fluttering fancies of the borough-bravadoes conceiving that the barge was down, they returned in a joyous flight home; next day they went back, and on examining the rock, found it battered blue with the leaden bullets, since which time it has been termed the Frenchman's Rock. PAWCHLE.-A frail old body, seeming, as it were, to paw</p>

            <p>for assistance; also, a person of low stature, rather silly. PAWMIE. A name for the Knave at Cards; oftener Jack. PAWT.-To paw with the feet; she never gaed a pawt, she never moved her feet.</p>

            <p>PEANERFLEE.-A light-looking, craw o' a body; one like Auld Ned, who looks like taking the air. Ned is really a wonderful soul, and singular enough in his way; an honest body, full of life, and takes a glass of good whisky with any man; his intimmers are of the best kind, he can be drunk and sober three times in a day; can drink as much as would fill three strong men full; tarr ar a, tantra bubus, big bull waggie, bow, wow, wow, is Ned's song, which he gives with a scraigh when fou; indeed, he is <pb n="377" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA377#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />the finest scraigher I ever heard; he has no care, and as for the kicks of the world and fortune, he values them nothing.</p>

            <p>PEATCLAIG. A place built with stones to hold peats. PEATNUIK.-A nook to hold peats, generally a dark corner; it is the prison in country schools for culprits and dunces, and is the first gaol of many that bad boys are frequently put into. In a worthy dominie's diary, the following funny day's work appears :-" 24th May-A little restive the greater part of the night, was often lying on my right side, often on my left: started at six, said prayers, washed face, and mounted hill to look about me; a fine breeze S. S. W. thin clouds over the sun's face. Saw the fox steal into the wood with a hen between his jaws; thought at first it was my white duck, was agreeably surprised on finding it was not she. Found a lark's nest, and four young ones in it; put up my mark, so that I might see it again; thought about taming a lark, then thought again there might be despotism in me if I did so, laughed at the idea; took breakfast, eat three eggs, wife a little sulky; opened school at ten, looked the key to Hutton's Arithmetic, found the boys riotous, put three to the peatnuik; opened a new Latin class, saw a beauty in Horace I had not seen before. Boys still riotous, put two more to the peatnuik; plied my cane freely, broke it o'er a young rascal's head, had a sorry day's teaching; let the school out an hour sooner then usual, looked at my lancets, went and bled a female friend; met at her house a young man from Edinburgh, a doctor, found much medical knowledge in him; came home, wife in better humour, planted some cabbages, took the cow to the bull;" so ends that day's principal transactions.</p>

            <p>PECHAN.-The belly; peching, blowing; pech, to blow. PEDRALL. A child beginning to walk; paidle.</p>

            <p>PELLOCK S.-Porpoises; seen before a storm PEN. An old saucy man, with a sharp nose. PENN.-A sewer; see Rummling Sire. PENPUNT.-Waefu' cheel, as he used to term himself, when running the country. For Penpunt was a beggar of strange character, and because he belonged to the clauchen o' Penpunt, from it had he is name, and well was known for long all over the country. Though pretty well liked by folks as a poor man, he was a greedy wretch, and outwalked all other vagrants that crossed his path; could walk between fifty and sixty miles every day, and call at all houses that came in his way; on entering a house he used always to sing out-" Here comes Auld Penpunt, waefu' cheel, gie him his awmous, and let him rin again!" He understood the art of begging well, could tell a tolerable tale, and sing a smutty Galloway snatch, such as the Bonny Muirhen; and also shew that he knew more than one would have thought. A brade blue bonnet wore he, ane bonnet like a winnowing wecht; a plaid was always fanked round his shoulders, so with a large rung or bourdoun in hand, rambled Penpunt; his wife and family would never eat any of his awmous meal. On a brother of his who had a small farm, he often insisted to take the mealpowk by the string, and follow <pb n="379" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />him, as his trade was much better than farming; he would often say, "that begging was not worthy the following gin, ane cudna turn a crown a day at it." He departed this life, waefu' man, about two or three years since, and was honoured with some notice, in the obituary of a Dumfries newspaper</p>

            <p>Tho' his tongue was na blunt,</p>

            <p>Penpunt's Epitaph.</p>

            <p>PETER A DICK'S PEATSTACK.-A favourite dancing step with the peasantry, performed by giving three flegs with - the feet, and two stamps with the heel alternately; such is the simple dance, the movement of the feet correspond to these words when said at the same time; indeed, the noise the feet makes, seems to speak them-Peter a Dick, · Peter a Dick, Peter a Dick's Peatstack. It is commonly the first step dancing masters teach their pupils; the A, B, C, &amp;c. of dancing science, when the scholars become tolerable at beetling it; they are next taught to fleup through the side-step; then Jack on the Green, Shawintrewse, and other hornpipes, with the Highland Fling, mayhap; these dances are all got pretty well by the fect - in the first month, with sketches of foursome, eightsome reels, and some country dances; but if the scholars attend the fortnight again of another month, they proceed at great length into the labyrinths of the art. A light heel'd sooter is generally the dancing dominie; he fixes on a barn in some clauchan to show forth in; he can both fiddle and dance, at the same time; can cut double quick time, and trible Bob Major; he fixes on, and publishes abroad when his trial night is to come on, so the young folks in the neighbourhood doff their clogs, and put on <pb n="380" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA380#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />their kirk-shoon, these being their dancing pumps; off they go to the trial, which, if it be a good turn-out, he tries no more, but begins teaching directly; if not, he has a second, and even a third trial; well, in the first month, as has been stated, such dances are taught; in the second, The "Flowers of Edinburgh," mayhap; Sweden and Belile's Marches, with other hornpipes, and country dances many; such as the Yillwife and her Barrles-Mary Grey— The wun that shook the barley, &amp;c. with the famous Bumpkin Brawley; yes, and they will even dare, sometimes, to imitate our Continental neighbours over the water, in their waltzing, alimanging, and Cotillion trade; ay, and be up with the Spaniards too, in their quadrills, barellos, and falderalloes of nonsense; so out-taught, they become fit to attend house-heatings, volunteer, and masonnic balls, what not. Partners are taken to the practeezings and balls; these girls, whom boys choose thus to partner them, are commonly beloved by them for ever afterwards; indeed, love is first felt by thousands at dancing-schools; to those sweet dears, ribbons, lockets, and strings o' beads, are brought, adorn their fair bodies. Now, after all, I am not meaning to laugh at this art, nor do I intend to praise it. Dancing is a famous amusement, but, like every art, I have known some better at it who were never taught than those who were; who could give a hooh and a crack with their heels, in a wonderful funny original manner,</p>

            <p>PETER'S PLEUGII.-The constellation Ursa Major, or the big bear; the twa big stars o' the soam, point to the Pole star.</p>

            <p>"Lang Peter's Pleugh lift hintings round the Pole."</p>

            <p>Wallet Poem.</p>

            <p>PETT-DAYS. Good days, among foul weather. A pet is always a dangerous creature; thus a child, petted by its parents, plays the devil some day or other in the world; <pb n="381" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA381#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />a sheep petted, is apt to turn a duncher; and a friend, dawted too much, is likely to become an adder. PEYAY.-The call milk-maids make for calves to come to their mothers.</p>

            <p>PEYVEE.-A strange nonsensical bustle, for no end; a ceremonious fluster; some people are always in a peyvee throng, seemingly to the last degree, yet doing little; still in a breathless state, without a moment's time to spare to speak to an honest man, who bicker quick along the streets, and have brains full of emptiness.</p>

            <p>PICK and CHUSE.-Select, and stand by the selected; to find a wife, in the wide world of women, then keep by her.</p>

            <p>PICKING-CAUVE.-Cows are said to pick-cauve, when they have miscarriages; that is to say, bring forth their young before the proper period; when one cow in a flock takes this, gee generally more of them do. Farmers, to prevent this, take good care not to irritate their cows, by bringing dogs amongst them, or shedding blood of oxen on their pasture.</p>

            <p>PICKTHANK.-A talepyet; one who bites behind backs. PIEING. Looking steadfastly at some object; like a dog.</p>

            <p>when he sees ground a stirring by a mole in it; how he Jooks, making his head move from side to side, before he pounces.</p>

            <p>PIEPHER.-An extremely useless creature, probably a cypher; a nothing in a common wealth, such is a piephering monkey. PIGGS.-Porcelain ware. Piggs and whustles, a man's foolish furniture, nick nacks, which are always in the way. Pigg-wives, females who trudge the country with trackpot ware, bowls, plates, &amp;c. they are only one remove from common beggars, and mostly more disliked. PAKET-BODIES.-People narrowly disposed, who grub</p>

            <p>and pick pikings, food left after a feast. "Dogs are flung <pb n="382" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA382#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />banes to pike." A beggar man once got a bone from a miser to pick, and was observed on the sunny side of a dyke, piking it with his specks on, which bespoke the charitable donor.</p>

            <p>PILLION-A sack filled with soft matter for people to ride</p>

            <p>on; also pillions are sacks and budgets full of soft stuffs. PINGLE-TO strive, to kemp, to compete; pingle-pans, little pans for preparing food for babes in.</p>

            <p>་</p>

            <p>PINKERTON-A person beneath expectation, one with a small mind, with only a pink, or small gleam of light in it, such as Sawnie Corbie, who, being at a parish kirk once, with a "split new suit o' claes on," after the preaching was owre, a wat day came on; Sawnie, loath to have his clothes steeped, flung them off his back, bundled them in his plaid, and skelped home mither naked; such is a pinkerton, or pinkie.</p>

            <p>PINKLE-PANKLE-The sound of liquid in a bottle. PIPER'S CO' o' COWEND-A very celebrated Gallovidian</p>

            <p>cave in the parish of Colvend; it is situated on a lonely shore, and frequently is heard the sound of the bagpipe therein; whiles the wild pibroch is a merry, but oftener a melancholy air; some think the piper the devil, others fancy the musician to be some kind carline, who reveres the memory of departed Highlanders, who were anciently smothered in the cave; there is also a bottomless well in it, at least one which lead and cord hath not yet sounded.</p>

            <p>PIRNIES-Night-caps, woven of various coloured threads, such as those bearing the name of Killmarnock. The Laird o' Broomcleuch was a bachelor, and for many years was troubled with a swelling in the breast, so that the old gentleman could scarcely bestir himself any where; so his friends gathered about him like corby-craws, and one took away this part of his property, another that, until the laird's house became almost entirely empty, or, as he said <pb n="383" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA383#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />himself, "they herried me." One day while he was sitting alone in his mansion, reflecting about its emptiness, a monkey which he kept, and which his relations did not think worthy to carry away, came frisking about him, leaped on to his shoulder, and plucked off his pirnie, making off with the booty as fast as it could spang. The laird, at this, fell into a tremendous fit of laughter, which so much agitated the swollen breast, that it burst in the interior with an awful gush, the which bilious matter he vomited up, and in a short time was able to move about amongst his friends, and thank them for the kindness and attention they had shewn him during his illness, by desiring them, in not a very pleasant tone, to return him every article which they had forcibly purloined; afterwards he made a will, in which, I believe, there was no mention made of those who so kindly attended his sick bed; such is always the fate of the over-greedy</p>

            <p>For if they glie and grasp at a'</p>

            <p>The devil ha'et they'll get ava'.</p>

            <p>PIRR-Blood is said to pirr from the wound made by a lancet; a girl is said to look pirr when gaily dressed. Pirr is also a sea-fowl with a long tail and black head, its feet are not webbed; it flies above the bosom of the calm sea, and whenever it sees any small fish or fry, dives down through the air on them, crying "pirr!" It lays five eggs, somewhat like tewhit eggs in size and colour. PIRKUZ-Any kind of perquisite.</p>

            <p>PISHMINNIES-Ants; pish means piss; pishminnie tammocks, or hillans, ant-hills; pish also means a heavy fall of rain.</p>

            <p>PISK-A dry-looking, saucy girl; pisket-grass, dried, shrivelled grass; any thing withering dry is pisky; to behave dryly to a friend is to behave pisket.</p>

            <p>PITTER-PATTER-All in a flutter; sometimes pillie-pattie, the movements of a perturbed heart.</p>

            <pb n="384" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA384#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>PLODDERAN-Toiling night and day almost; the first thing that disgusted me with a farmer's life, and what disgusts thousands at it, is the not having a moment of time that can be said to be our own.</p>

            <p>PLOTTED-Boiled, or ratherly plunged in boiling water. PLUMB-The noise a stone makes when plunged into a deep pool of water; people guess as to a pool's depth by this plumb.</p>

            <p>PLUMROCKS-Primroses; in some places pimroses.</p>

            <p>POCKIAWRD-Marked with the small-pox.</p>

            <p>POCKSHAKINGS-The youngest children of families.</p>

            <p>PODDS-The boxes wherein nature preserves the seeds of various plants; a bean podd, that holds five beans, and a pea podd, which contains nine peas, are considered to be sonsy, and put up above the lintle of the door by maidens, and the first male that enters after they are so placed will either be their husband, or like him.</p>

            <p>PORR-To stab; the noise a sharp instrument makes, darting into the flesh.</p>

            <p>PORTUALE-A singular song, commonly sung about Christ mas. See White boys.</p>

            <p>Poss-To squeeze wet clothes in a tub, to wash by squeezing.</p>

            <p>POSSEY-A large party of people all of a mind.</p>

            <p>POUCHING-The trick of pocketing; if a lady shows us her garden, and we fall to the plucking of fruit and eating it, before she grauts permission, do we not behave rudely? and if we pull and pocket, our manners become abominable. In truth, pouching is a gentle method of stealing, and I would as soon become a real thief at once as a petty poucher. Some people, though, have a natural propensity this way, and others can look at every thing, but touch nothing; but those who pouch at funerals are the most hateful race of pouchers. One in particular, which I will not trouble myself to write his detestable name, whenever <pb n="385" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA385#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />the service came round to him, he looked for the largest piece of short-breud or plumb-cake on the servet, seized on it with a sharkish manner, took a bite of one corner, and pouched the rest. The wine or drink with which he was served to, baffled him to play the same trick with it; but he pouched, or painched it every drop, another way. Once some wags espied my gentleman very throng at a wealthy funeral, and as the burial folk had to come down a strait stair after they lifted, they made up a plan to there jostle him, and ease his large wallets of their contents, which they accomplished very handsomely, by some going before and others behind, the upper pushing, the under stelling, while an expert hand brought out the cargo, consisting, no doubt, of sundries, all of which were never missed by him until he came home; but on his there discovering that the treasure was extracted, he got such a shock of remorse, as never allowed him to pouch any more.</p>

            <p>POULLIE-HENS-Plucked-looking hens; poullie, to look plucked like; poul, a mollan, a pole.</p>

            <p>POUT-To start up on a sudden, as something from under the water; to pow up, to shew the head, pow being the head; pout-worm, the worm with the head, the grub, POUTREY-Poultry; pouts, young game birds. Pow-The head; pow-heads, young frogs.</p>

            <p>There's little wit in the pow,</p>

            <p>That hauds the cannle to the lowe.</p>

            <p>Auld Say.</p>

            <p>PREEN-CUDS-Pin-cushions, places to hold preens, and</p>

            <p>corking-preens.</p>

            <p>PREEST-CAT-An ingleside game; a piece of stick is made red in the fire; one hands it to another, saying</p>

            <p>Then round is handed the stick, and whomsoever's hand it goes out in, that is in a wad, and must kiss the crook, the <pb n="386" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA386#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />cleps, and what not, ere he gets out of it; anciently, when the priest's cat departed this life, wailing began on the country side, as it was thought it became some supernatural being, a witch, perhaps, of hideous form; so to keep it alive was a great matter.</p>

            <p>"Lilly Cuckoo, Lilly Cuckoo,</p>

            <p>"Sticks and stanes, lie at thy weary banes, "If thou fa', for a' I blaw,</p>

            <p>"Lilly Cuckoo, Lilly Cuckoo.".</p>

            <p>This rhyme is common in the priest-cat sport toward the border.</p>

            <p>PREEST-DRIDDER-Dread of priests. Not long ago people in the country were very much in awe of their priests; they considered them creatures supernaturally endowed, fit to lay ghaists, talk with boggles and spreets, shake hands with death, and do many other such wonders. Them and their sessions, their cutty-stools, and full bottom'd wigs, hollow granes, and dranting prayers, made the fowk at times almost swarf with a dridder or dread. But Burns, and other clear-brained fellows arose in time, and after stripping them to the buff, let the bleer-e❜ed see that the priests were like ither fowk, and many of them even worse. I give the clergymen of Scotland no claim at all to the better light now beaming in the country, for they wished to keep all in darkness, rather than otherwise, "brutes being easier managed than men;" but in spite of their clouds we got suns, whose rays penetrated them. I am no foe at all to them, as they are now-a-days; but am far from obeying the old proverb, "that corbies and clergy are a shot right kittle." I feel no quams of conscience in speaking about them what I think, whenever they chance to come in my way. Though a greedy enough squad, yet still I take some pleasure in going to church to hear them preach now and then; but for dread they give me none, nor can they give any to a manly person; a black coat and a blue one causing the same sensations of dridder.</p>

            <p>PRIGGING. Higgling in market-making; some merchants alter not the price of their goods, let the buyer prigg as he may. I think, however, there is something natural in a seller to fall a little in the first value he lays on to the purchaser.</p>

            <p>PRODDS.-Pricks; proddled, pricked; the same nearly with proitled.</p>

            <p>PROITLED. To stir after a pushing manner, as we do when we wish to rouse burntrouts out of water-rat holes; we proitle them out from beneath the overhanging brows with the but-end o' the fish-wan.</p>

            <p>PROKER.-Poker, for stirring fires.</p>

            <p>PROO.-Cry, at horses when they are wanted to stand still, or, at least, not to gallop.</p>

            <p>PROOP. The still small voice of a certain wind-pipe; one</p>

            <p>of the children of that strange animal which flies wingless. We hear of animals broken wund, what are these? viz. those which breathe quick, which have a kind of asthmatic wheezle; horses are sometimes this way, so think that respectable class of men, horse-jockies, who are themselves oftener broken wund. "I hate stane naigs," quoth one the other day, "but waur I hate them wha lead them." Broken wun and braking wun are different though, hech how.</p>

            <p>PSALM-SINGING BODIES.-Religious folk, of an austere</p>

            <p>disposition. When those sacred pieces of poetry, termed paraphrases, were first introduced into the public worship of our maker-An old woman, one of these rigid righteous, said "They did na taste sae weel in her gab as the auld p'salms o' Davie;" and to make another trivial remark, an Irishman who had been engaged with a farmer during harvest, was astonished one evening with his master when he started the psalm, to be sung as a thing preparatory to the taking the buik. The poor fellow, who had probably never heard of such a thing, or of the psalms <pb n="388" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA388#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />either, exclaimed, after the family had lilted a verse or two, probably with all the swing of old Coleshill, or the Martyrs, "Hoch! botheration, what kind of singing is that? stop, and I'll give ye a barr or two of the bleaching pin." To please these holy folk, these psalm-singing bodies, I may give a few verses, written by a Galloway bard, guess who</p>

            <p>PUDDOCKS. Frogs. Puddock-pipes, a moss herb. Puddock-stools, a kind of long-shanked conical and comical mushroom. Puddock-reed, the spawn or rid of frogs; what says the auld stave</p>

            <p>PUE O'REEK.-A little smoke, or, ratherly the manner smoke ascends. "The reek's pueing up." "There's no a pue o' reek in a' the house." "Whar comes the reek pueing frae?" are phrases I need not explain.</p>

            <p>PUIST-BODIES.-People in a comfortable way in this world, or ratherly having the wherewithal to make them so. Some are puist, though not contented; but we cannot be puist unless we are competently rich; we ought to be pretty contented, though not rich. For my own part, I have been as happy without a bawbee in my pouch, as I ever was with gowd in it.</p>

            <p>PULING, or PEULING.-The way of a sick animal; it leaves its comrades, and gaes peuling about alone-commonly applied to cattle. Peuls, small bites which sick oxen eat. For these bites nowt seek mosses in the spring, where peuls of green grass first appear; to get at them, they frequently lose their life, and are drowned; also at this season, they tumble down heughs while ranging for these peuls. A Herd must keep a sharp look out in the waur time.</p>

            <p>PUNSE. To push and strike, as with a stick, to punse a brock in his lair; to push, or ratherly striking push, a badger in his den.</p>

            <p>PUTT-GUDE.—A man is said to have made his putt-gude, when he obtains what his ambition panted for; thus I have got my putt made good respecting this book, for all the thousand barrs flung in its way. This compliment to the land of my home, I intend, perhaps, on some not very far distant day, to give, in one large quarto volume, "The <pb n="390" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA390#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />Scotch Encyclopædia, or the natural, original, and antiquated curiosities of Scotland." I have much matter gathered for it; and hope every true Scotsman who loves his own wonderful country, will help me with it, as they think best, by giving me hints, and singular out-of-the-way whusherings; so, this work is only the harbinger of one of the same stamp, but on a larger scale; and I hope Heaven will permit me to make my putt-gude.</p>

            </entry>

            <p>QUAKINQUAWs--or Quaws, or moving quagmire bogs; some fancy that Jack and the Lantern, alias Will o' the Wisp, has his habitation in the Quakingquaw, from his being generally seen in the neighbourhood of such places, and from his desire to conduct the midnight wanderers therein; it is also imagined, too, that they are entrances, as it were, to other strange worlds, where are ever myriads of fowk, such as were seen in the Carlines o' Cairnsmoor. When the method of boring through the soil of a wet bog was tried, so that the water might sink, and find vent away in the rocky stratas beneath, a poor superstitious mortal was standing by once, observing attentively how operations went on, and when he beheld what every one present did, that the plan would not answer, he went up to the borers, and insisted on them, (through wit) to go through with the borer into the world below, and then the waters would follow. He was not like a certain gentleman, who loved good liquor, as many do, and who went into an agricultural society once, when draining land was the order <pb n="391" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA391#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />of the day; there stood the laird, and listened to one speech after another, on the benefits which would no doubt result from such and such sure grounded modes as were proposed; at length, getting weary, he exclaimed, "For God's sake, gentlemen, leave as much water with all your drainings as will mix a glass o' grog;" which satire rendered all plans useless for that day at least. My worthy original, well known in Galloway by the phrase, “For faith ye see am saying," knew, amongst many other things, like the late mentioned gentleman, where all the spring wauls of note were in the country, and their names— which information he gave me in the kindest manner, for which I here, according to the custom of authors, publicly thank him.</p>

            <p>QUINTON RUMMLEKIRN-A pretty fair Galloway.philosopher and poet, who flourished, according to the book of Doomsday, kept by Scoot Hutchie, in the time come never, three months ago. He was a cronnie while he lived with the Miller o' Minnieive, and, I believe, married his killman's third daughter-the one with the buck-teeth. He was fond of drinking filthy fluids, and his belly gave birth to some asks and man-keepers. I do not know that I have explained man-keepers: they are a kind of nimble lizard, and run about quarry-holes, in warm weather. It is said, that like the robin-breestie, they are in love with man, hence their name, and like that bird, no man will harm them. They are serpent-looking creatures, which he keeps as it were. Well, this Quinton flashed about Tibby Sharpers for a few months, but kicked up his heels at last in Auld Ned's anti-chamber, after quaffing vitriolic mountain dew. He gave me, when living, the meanings of a few rare words, though I differ with him, in some respects, as to their import. Thus peelaflee, he said, was a creature out of its element; a dandy attempting to play with men at the channelstane, for the dandy looks as if the wind had him peeled, and that he looked as if going to fly. A being much liker a warm room, sitting by the hip of a lisping lady, and a simmering trackpot. Peelaflees are all those who look better on a street than they do in the country. It is a strange thing that, termed optics; how full is it of deception. I wonder those Brewsters, and other chaps who study it, cannot give us something to prevent our e'en being misled. Thus, some ladies look well in candle-light, and they all look their best in frosty weather. Let no man marry a wife in the time of frost, for when a thaw comes, she may disgust him. Bullocks look best in snow when cattle are transported from "heathy fells to flowery dells," they have quite a different appearance; ay, ay. "Brocks look best catching bumclocks;" situation is <pb n="393" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA393#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />every thing. On the fore ground of a Scotch dinner, the haggis should show his hurdies; and on the back the whusky grey-beardy." But to Quinton, as a philosopher, he said I was a fool, and he would prove it as fair as ever a mathematician proved Euclid's fifth in first to be Pons Assinorum, or the Asses Bridge; but I said it was needless o prove what all my acquaintance knew to be a fib; and that the world would say some day I was a damned clever fallow, one who would do what Archimedes could not do, make this very earth tremble in her orbit. The old millwright, and speckglass-grinder said, if he had a fulcrum he could do this, as he had a lever ready. Now, I have found the fulcrum, which is my mighty—I was just going to add, genius, when Quinton struck me beneath the lug, with a hazle-rung, cut in Plunton wud, and laid me sprawling on Kirkcubries auld causey, just at Christal's Corner. So farewel to him and his philosophy. Let us view him as a poet, and firstly then-</p>

            <p>QUIRKLUMS-Little arithmetic puzzles, where the matter hinges on a quirk. The peasantry are madly fond to have their great minds always employed, either at one thing or another; so they propose quirklums, as they do riddlums, and set one another a thinking upon them. Quirklums make them lay at the thinking, perhaps, as much as any thing; and those of a mathematic turn, like my friends Geordy Wishart and Jeamie Caig, are the best at solving them. These quirklums are generally told in rhyme, and many of them are not unamusing. For fun, I may give one or two of them</p>

I met with the other day, while reading the works of Hallagree, the famed Persian poet, the Walter Scott of the east, an arithmetical quirkle, so set about the translation instantly, for the benefit of the curious; but though Van Bluffberg, the celebrated Dutch linguist was at my elbow, we found it no easy matter to hold strictly by the original.

ELEGY on the DEATH o'a puir PET CORBIEHe wandered from home one day away by the Netherlaw, and having fallen in with the coat of mine auld crusty herd, Davie Maben, he turned inside out the pockets of the same; and while in the act of making off with Dawvid's spleuchan, he was set upon by the herd's collie-dog, and the attack being followed by the herd himself with a stick, they succeeded in ending the life of my pet corbie—</p>

RAGGING-Corn is said to be a ragging when it is a putting the first time through the fans, or winnowing machine. When this is done it is ragged, cleaned of its rags and roughness; also corn is said to be beginning to ragg when the grain-head first appears out of the shotblade; corn first rags which grows on the sides of riggs, by the furbrow, and if none ragged be seen before Kelton-hill Fair, it is a symptom there is going to be a late harrest that year. RAIRDING-Ice is said to be rairding, when it is cracking from some cause; in the time of a very hard frost, lochs are heard to rair of their own accord.</p>

In one of these, mention is made of the rannle-tree. "The cat ran up the rannle-tree wi' a lump o' raw red liver in its teeth." For fun, I may give more of these sayings. The peasant's cottage is indeed a den of curiosity. Briskly reeks Rab Logan's lum," and "Rab Logan's lum reeks briskly;"</p>

            <p>another, "I can count the cuts, and the cuts count me;" then to the sieve and the thissels, and who shall say criffles clear oftenest, without drawing breath. RAP and STOW-A phrase meaning root and branch. RASHES-Rushes; " as straught's a rash"-straight as a rush. Straight people are likened to a rush commonly. Rashbuss, a bush of rushes; rash-whups, rash-bonnets, rashpyddles, are whips, caps, and fish-wears, made of rushes: rush also means a fall of rain, attended with wind; "hear to the rain rashing," hear to it dashing. "The spuings came rushing frae him," means, he vomited freely. RATTON—A rat. Ratton-fa', a rat-trap; ratton-flitting, a fitting of rats. Sometimes these animals, for causes known to themselves, leave one haunt where they have fed well a long time, and go to another. Many have met them thus removing, and leading the old blind ones with a straw, which passed between mouths like a kissing-string. What instinct is this? Those Percy Anecdote folks should have heard of the matter. People do not like the rats to disappear thus on a sudden, as the thing is thought to portend nothing good, and sailors will leave their ships if they observe the rats quit them.</p>

            <p>RAWLY-Not ripe. Rawly cheel, a young lad. RAW-WEATHER-Cold wet weather; this is much disliked by rural hinds.</p>

            <p>REE. A round sheep-fold, where sheep are put into on snowy nights, to hinder the snow to ree, or wreath them up; <pb n="406" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA406#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />as the wind, by whirling round this circle, lets the snow not wreath in it. Ree, is often confounded with bught, but a sheep-ree and a sheep-bught, are different; a bught is a little bight to catch sheep in, no matter what be its figure. To ree grain, is to whirl it through a riddle, so that the tares in it may be seen; this ree then, and the other ree, are one; we say rees o' snaw, for wreaths of snow, and whiles wrides; let this word ree then, be properly understood; but there is another ree, with which it seems to claim no kindred. When a man is rammaged, that is, rais'd, craz'd, or damaged with drink, we say that man looks ree; he looks mad and flushed. A poet too, in a wild phrenzy, with fancy flashing from earth to heaven, and from thence to hell, looketh ree. Poets are generally drawn this way, by artists. In truth, Byron always looks in a print shop as if he saw the devil; why, ye draughtsmen, make all the sons of genius look like fools? it is nonsense,</p>

            <p>For Bob, I will invert your rule,</p>

            <p>REEZIE. A horse is reezie when he is inclined to whisk</p>

            <p>RIDDLUMS. Riddles, sometimes called guesses; some of the riddles of the peasantry are worth a laugh, so I will not pass them over; they have a peculiar nature of their own, and a rural riddle is at once known from one of foreign manufacture. Riddlums and quirklums are in some instances like other. As a farmer asked another "how many shearers he had in his banwun?" the other answered, "I hae one hundred and, twenty bansmen, sae ye may guess frae that;" well, as a bandsman generally binds to five shearers, the inquirer began his calculation, by multiplying the 120 by 5; when he had done, "bless me, (quoth he) hae ye sax hunner shearers ?"-" Na, na, (said the other) ye hae counted yourself out of it; I have just what I said, one hundred shearers, and twenty bandsmen; but because I didna make a wee stop, after saying the hunner, ye took me up wrang." This one is just like that ball, with the three-score-and-three fiddlers at it, each fiddler having twenty dancers, how many dancers were there?</p>

            <p>"Bonny Kittie Brawnie she stands at the wa,</p>

            <p>"Gie her meikle, gie her little, she licks up a'</p>

            <p>"Gie her stanes, she'll no eat them, and water she'll dee,</p>

            <p>"Come tell me that bonny riddlum to me."</p>

            <p>This is a favourite Scotch riddle, meaning the fire.</p>

            <p>As I cam owre Lonon Brig,</p>

            <p>I met wi' Geordy Caning,</p>

            <p>I took aff his head, and drank his bluid,</p>

            <p>And left his body staning.</p>

            <p>A bottle of ale.</p>

            <p>Come tell me wha was that sannie,</p>

            <p>Wha was got afore his father,</p>

            <p>Wha was born afore his mither,</p>

            <p>And wha took the maidenhead o' his grannie.</p>

            <p>Answer-Abel; for his father was not begot, nor his mother born; his grand-mother was the earth, he was the first who was bedded in it; as Eve was his mother, a piece of frail earth also.</p>

            <pb n="408" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA408#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>"As I stood cn yon castle wa'</p>

            <p>"I saw the dead carrying the quick awa."</p>

            <p>Answer-a boat.</p>

            <p>"What gangs through the wood what it can flee,</p>

            <p>"And never touches a single tree?"</p>

            <p>The expression in this riddle, of going what it can fly, belongs purely to Galloway. "If I gang tae town the day I'll ride," is a phrase often flung in the teeth of the natives, by those of other districts, as extremely vulgar, but it is not so; for you may go, which is ganging any way you will; you may either riding go, flying go, or swimming go, the grammar is good: when "heard ye any news?" is asked, the answer is frequently-" No, I heard na as meikle as ae auld wife dinging owre anither;" and when to alarm a party, with saying to them, "did ye hear you awfu' news the day?" when no is replied, with much trepidation; the answer is made, "why I heard to-day that a man had ta'en the levelling o' Cairnhattie, and that twaul mile square o' the sea has been brunt ayont the Isle o' Man." But where do I ramble? Was I to note down all the sports I have heard in my native country, a book as large as Noah's Ark would hardly hold them; of riddlums then, I take my leave, by proposing a popular one, which may be answered as thought best:</p>

            <p>"What is it, that is skinless born,</p>

            <p>"And whilk doth wingless fly,</p>

            <p>"To death a rairing it doth go,</p>

            <p>"Perfuming earth and sky ?"</p>

            <p>RIDING FOR THE BROESE.-This scene has been somewhat touched by other rustic writers, so I briefly say, "That it is a ride on horseback by the wadding fowk attending a bridegroom to the bride's house; he who has the swiftest horse wins the broese, or a cog of good broth made for the occasion." It may well be fancied then, that this is a horse-race, worth all those, for good fun, that ever were run at Newmarket. A gourmand Moor-farmer once gained the broese, so long before his rivals came, that <pb n="409" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA409#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />he had the whole cog-full lapped into his kyte; when they came up, he was just at the heels o't, after which he gave it to his collie to lick the lagging.</p>

            <p>RIDING the BEETLE.-Those who are on foot, or shanks naigie, with a party on horseback, are said to be riding the beetle.</p>

            <p>"War ye at the fair, saw ye mony people,</p>

            <p>"Saw ye our gude man riding on the beetle?"</p>

            <p>Auld sang.</p>

            <p>RIDING the STANG.-A public punishment, inflicted on adulterers and fornicators. A large pole is got, and passed between the culprit's legs; he is then carried and cudgelled through clauchans, to the laugh and scorn of the mob. If the guilty man is married, and hath been leaving his wife and debauching young girls, he is then carried by men, the ends of the pole are manned with males; but if he hath been caught with another man's wife, fcmales bear him forth; if he be unmarried, and hath been toying with men's wives, young men carry him, and so forth; it is a very severe punishment, but perhaps not so bad as the crime.</p>

            <p>RIG-ADOWN DAISY.-At weddings, anciently the waddin fowk danced a great deal on the grass, before they went into barns; this fun was termed rig-adown daisy.</p>

            <p>RIGG and FURR.-Land is said to be divided into rig and fur, when parcelled into ridges, by furrows; some kinds of hoze are called rig and furr.</p>

            <p>RIGLING. A ram with one stone in the scrotum, the other</p>

            <p>is about the parts of the back, and sometimes not at all;</p>

            <p>this is an animal between the tip and dumchaser.</p>

            <p>RHYNE.-Hoar frost.</p>

            <p>RINGING BLACK FROST.-A very severe frost when the ground keeps black, and seems to ring when struck; this is the season for channling or playing at the chamilestone; few stars stud the lift at this scason; the moon has a <pb n="410" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA410#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />brass face on, and a dark-brown haze hangs round the horizon.</p>

            <p>RINNER.-A little brook; also, butter melted with tar, for sheep-smearing.</p>

            <p>RINNINGS.-Ulcers, which are the fountains of running</p>

            <p>matter.</p>

            <p>RINS O' GALLOWA.-The borders, roons, or selvages of Galloway. The rilings or ravelings, or ruggid margins of the country.</p>

            <p>RIZZLING. Any thing such as straw, is said to be rizzling, when it is free of moisture, quite dry, rustling.</p>

            <p>ROBBIN-A-REE.-A game of the ingle-nuik, much like the preest-cat; only in passing the brunt-stick round the ring, the following rhyme is said :—</p>

            <p>"Robin-a-Ree, ye'll no dee wi' me,</p>

            <p>"Tho' I birl ye roun' a three-times and three,</p>

            <p>"O Robin-a-Ree, O Robin-a-Ree,</p>

            <p>"O dinna let Robin-a-Reerie dee."</p>

            <p>I have been somewhat pestered to know who or what</p>

            <p>this Robin-a-Ree was.</p>

            <p>The old song here brings him</p>

            <p>before us in another shape.</p>

            <p>I dinna like the Meg o' mony feet,</p>

            <p>Nor the brawnet Conochworm,</p>

            <p>Quoth Mary Lee, as she sat and did greet,</p>

            <p>A dawding wi' the storm;</p>

            <p>Nowther like I the yallow-wym'd-ask,</p>

            <p>'Neath the root o' yon aik tree,</p>

            <p>Nor the hairy adders on the fog that bask,</p>

            <p>But waur I like Robin-a-Ree.</p>

            <p>There are two other Robbins, celebrated in an out-of</p>

            <p>the-way kind of song, which I feel inclined also to give</p>

            <p>Twa lads at Clauchendolly bide,</p>

            <p>Wha I lo'e weel, they're baith sae spree,</p>

            <p>ROBBIN BREESTIE-The Robin Redbreast; in Germany,</p>

            <p>Tommy Linden.</p>

            <p>The following poem, termed the Twa</p>

            <p>Burdies, I give, for why, it hath very little poetic merit,</p>

            <p>but treats of the Robbin Breestie, and the Willie Wag-</p>

            <p>tail, and has a tolerable moral:-</p>

            <p>Whan a wunter storm was ance taking its breath,</p>

            <p>And the snaw did cease to drift,</p>

            <p>And the sun peeped through a straight blue bore,</p>

            <p>Laigh, laigh, i'the southeron lift.</p>

            <p>Twa burdies 'neath the easle o' an auld house,</p>

            <p>Sat chirpling out their wail,</p>

            <p>The tane o' them was the Robbin Breestie,</p>

            <p>And the tither the Wullie Wagtail.</p>

            <p>Puir Robbin's wings war hinging unco side,</p>

            <p>And his shankies seem'd truly sma',</p>

            <p>While Wallie's tail wi' its white and blae feathers,</p>

            <p>Cud hardly gie a wag ava.</p>

            <p>The twasome pied down on the cauld sneep snaw,</p>

            <p>Wi' the sorry hauf striffen'd e'e,</p>

            <p>A wee teat o' gool was no to be seen,</p>

            <p>Nor ane spawl'drochy lang-legged flee,</p>

            <pb n="413" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA413#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>Then follow me, quoth the Robbin Breestie,</p>

            <p>To his comrade the Wullie Wagtail,</p>

            <p>Let us bauldly enter yon bielie gill-ha',</p>

            <p>And for food we winna fail.</p>

            <p>Sae into the bonny ha' they did hap,</p>

            <p>And the bairnies them daigh did mool,</p>

            <p>Wee Mary ran out to the wannowing the corn,</p>

            <p>And brought them in plenty o' gool.</p>

            <p>Then on to the lip o' the meal-girnel,</p>

            <p>Lap Robbin and sang his sang;</p>

            <p>But Wullie the lad look wullyart and blate,</p>

            <p>And was wagging his tail fu' thrang.</p>

            <p>Ane bawdrons wha had kitlins under a bed,</p>

            <p>Whan she heard Robbin's sang,</p>

            <p>Came sprauchlin in a hurry out,</p>

            <p>And at Wullie Wagtail did spang.</p>

            <p>He flew against a lozen wi' a thud,</p>

            <p>Glass light deceived the cheil,</p>

            <p>Back fluttering he was dung, and cudna be saved,</p>

            <p>To bawdrons he did reel.</p>

            <p>She nyarr'd whan she gat him, as he had been a mouse,</p>

            <p>Or some lang-snouted, cheeping strow,</p>

            <p>Robbin sat still, and keep'd a calm sough,</p>

            <p>Than happ'd out whan he was fu'.</p>

            <p>A lesson is this to a' mankind,</p>

            <p>Whan we're strangers ony gate never fail</p>

            <p>To mark them that's name, like the Robbin Breestie,</p>

            <p>Or we're worried like the Wullie Wagtail.</p>

            <p>ROBBIN-RIN-THE-HEDGE-A trailing kind of weed, which runs along hedges, a robbin net; its seed sticks to woollen cloth.</p>

            <p>RONNET BAGS-The rennets for coagulating milk.</p>

            <p>ROON-SHOON-Shoes made of the roons, or selvages of</p>

            <p>cloth.</p>

            <p>ROOSING-Praising, with a little flattery. The Gallovidians are not much given to this fault; when the merchant asked auld Ned about the cow he intended to sell, what were her properties, and so forth, Ned, who knew nothing about roosing, or lying, said, "Why the cow has very little milk, and no butter at all;" Ned, indeed, did not butter up his property. Another man said of his friend's whisky, "that it was de'ils swear to gang down, nor wad it stay whan it was down." And a third, whom a neighbour was <pb n="414" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA414#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />buying seed corn from, the latter said that he doubted it wad not grow, as it was a wee thing o' the red early cast; "that's a queer thought of your's," (quoth the former) "for I'm sure it was de'ils fond to grow in the harrest-time;” but grain, when once it hath budded, and is checked, will not bud again. Such are swatches of the flattery of the peasantry. ROOV'D-Rivetted.</p>

            <p>Two persons once tried who would tell the largest lie; the first said, "he knew a fellow who made a ladder, and went up on it to the moon, and there drove a spike nail right through her face;" "O, but (says the other,) my fellow went up and roov'd that nail on the other side." "Well," (cried a third) “I think you are about equal; you may try again."</p>

A fox was once sadly beset in one of these rossens o' whuns; the hounds could not uncover him, so the ron was ..set in flames about his lugs; out he came with his tail a-blaze, like one of Sampson's, and was shot by one of the sentinels.</p>

            <p>RUG-A bed-cover; "as snug's a bug in a rug."-Old say. RULE O' THUMM-Rule of thumb, the king of all rules. The rule of three, and Pythagoras's golden rule are nothing to this; it is that rule whereby a person does something which no other can. Thus Burns wrote Tam o' Shanter by the rule o' thumm; this is the rule of genius, or the rule of nature, which surpasses all the rules of art; every soul knows less or more of this rule, and yet no two know exactly the same. Thus, who could compose this book like me?-None. Many might be found to do it better, and few worse; but none could do it exactly as I do; of course, then, I am making use of this valuable rule, and so doth every one; without book or dominie we all become acquainted with the rule o' thumm; we even gain the affections of the lasses by it-the only thing worthy of gain in this world.</p>

            <p>SADDLER HALLIDAY—A well-known Gallovidian original, of the Christian name James, but being bred a saddler, and becoming notorious, he is known by no other name than Saddler Halliday; when young he was the best-person'd man any where to be seen; when at his apprenticeship, dukes and lords, in passing through Dumfries, stopped their carriages to observe the young saddler. Having served out his time, he married his master's daughter, but she proving not to be a very good woman, and he none of the very best of men, they soon dissolved <pb n="417" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA417#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />partnership. He said of her, "that had he fished the loch o' hell wi' a tade on for a bait, he could not have drawn up a worse wife.” After this, he took a ramble away through England, as far as London, and drunk and was merry wherever he went, dipping at the same time deep into the knowledge of the ways of mankind, the most extensive science of any. But what may seem strange, he would not walk a mile undernight, no, not for all the world; here then do we behold a young strong man, nearly seven feet high, so afraid of boggles, that he could not move alone, when gloaming set in. He used to say, "that though very timorous he was this way, he was not so bad as the auld priest Nathan Mackie, who durst not gang to the door ate'en to unless ane of the servants gaed wi' him, and held him by the coat tail." The boggles have quite the upper hand of the saddler; once the cloud involved him in darkness on some of the roads of Galloway, so he would proceed no farther, and bolted into a barn by the way-side, and covered himself among some straw; about midnight he heard something like the moans and groans of some being in the same barn, and his fears squared, the sounds of distress increased, and at last a vomiting noise was heard; the smell of the disgorged matter told in the saddler's nose, that the being was nothing of the supernatural order; he sought it out, and who was this but his own worthy wife, hopeful woman? Next morning they parted again, and never, I have heard, have had the happiness to pass a night with each other again. It is long now since the Saddler became a wandering tradesman; he wanders from one friend's house in the country to another, and "fettles the naig graith." Bachelor's haws are his favourites; there he goes through his tales, and makes his pointed remarks; he is ratherly given to Scotch satire, which assists in making him the famous character he is; he has the manners of the best <pb n="418" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA418#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />bred gentleman at hand, whenever he needs to use them; his abilities wont to shine with brilliancy over a bottle, and the cock of all parties wherein was he, was always allowed to be Saddler Halliday.</p>

It takes its name from this though, as being able to save a young woman from shame, by her committing murder, a pretty way indeed. This is what makes gardeners and others wary about giving it to females. Burns fancies Hornbuik knew this tree. "She trust hersell to hide the shame in Hornbuke's care."</p>

            <p>SAWNIE, the SAILOR-No original is more worthy a place</p>

            <p>in this book than Sawnie Brown, or Sawnie the SailorBorn in Borgue, bred a farmer, ran off, and became a sailor when about twenty years of age. Sailed in the slave-trade; was impressed on board a man o' war; was at the taking the Cape of Good Hope, and at Monte Video, in South America. After serving his Majesty ten years against his will, he returned to his native country, and, like his ancestor, Sinbad the Sailor, recounted his wonderful adventures, and really wonderful they are; entirely true, as Sawnie never lied in his life. It is not <pb n="419" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA419#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />exactly the many brunts and strange scenes he has been in that make them so, but it is the strange observations he made in these brunts and broiliments, and the way he tells them; for what is singular, all the while he was away from friends, amidst foreigners in distant lands, his native tongue and native manners changed nothing; he came home a greater Borguenite than when he went away, and talked brader Scotch than any in the country; to hear him in this language telling of one of his shirramuirs, how laughable it is. I shall give the account of the battle of the Cape, as taken from his lips; all his other adventures I have also by me, and will give them to the world some day or other, for indeed they are as original things as I have met with. "Weel, the fleet started; I kend na whar the devil they war for. We had sogers without end aboard, wi' Sir David Baird and his white naig, and mair care was ta'en o' this white naig than o' ony human creature we had wi' us. Our Commodore, Sir H P——, was a damned lang yallow leug, wi' buck teeth; he never gaed lie hardly, but wad hae lain wi' his claise on 'twarthree minutes whiles aboon the blankets; he ay look'd oozilie, his hat a' in clours, and his coat covered wi' woo and stoure; he feared neither God nor the Devil, and his oaths made the auldest sailor aboard trimmle. After we had plunged at it for twar-three weeks, we saw the loom of the Cape, and soon landed the sogers on't, at a place three miles frae Cape Town, round the shore. The Dutch and French forces war to be fought next day; the sailors o' the fleet war to man the big guns; and I was ane amang the rest picked out to push and draw the meikle cannon on the fiel o' battle. Lord, I ken'd na now what to think, I had never been at a battle; a kind o' shilpetness cam owre me; wine was dealt roun'; I skilted at it, but had I drank at it till yet, it wad na hae doitered me, a noggin fu' has nae effect in a time o' that kind. The marching began about sunrise, and soon we cam in sight o' the enemy: how <pb n="420" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA420#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />the sun did dazzle on the sillar-laced claise o' the French troops; I looked at them whan I had time, but the haurling the guns keeped ane thrang. Soon we gat near them, and they began to burn powther first. I hated to hear the balls soughing by me, and thought on my Father's auld prayer, some o' which I said quitly to mysell. At length the faught began in earnest; gude Lord! what a tirrivee and stramash! We had twa Highland regiments; some o' the sogers in them being shot, the rest gat mad on the instant the moment they saw blood. Donald cudna be hadden in; they flew in on the fae with their bagonets, and sent the enemy in confusion. Now was the time for us; we pointed the guns to the greatest cludders, and they being loaded wi' grape, we just cutted roads through them, and fain war they to lay down their arms at our feet in a wee time, and ask for quarters; but the devil's o' Highland bodies seemed anxious for mair o't, and seemed vexed the dust was owre; mony a ane they necked after the battle was at an end. Then marched we into Cape Town, and stack up the flag. I was as black as the Ace o' Spades wi' gunpowther; but whan washed and dressed, faith I was as weel as ever; the de'il the scart I had got, though I had morroch'd through the mids o't. I was glad at this, and gaed away, and saw the bonny lasses o' the Cape." So goeth Saronie on, and who would not be pleased to listen? but I shall let him rest at this time until I bring out the strange " Adventures of Sawnie, the Sailor." The following is two verses of his</p>

The black rock looking out of the sulky deep, seems to have a white ruff round its neck; the gloomy bank appears over the southern horizon; the ships come tilting over the waves to places of shelter, when turning down the swell of the billow, the rudder waves in air, and then swing they round, lurching in the hollow of the sea, while the maws fly skying by the sounding shore, and the raven seems to rejoice in the coming storm :—</p>

            <p>As good a pilot's Ben,</p>

            <p>Through the most stormy season,</p>

            <p>I right could steer me then.</p>

            <p>On rocks I'd ne'er be crashing,</p>

            <p>And weeping with despair,</p>

            <p>But merrily on be dashing,</p>

            <p>So trig and debonair.</p>

            <p>Sleep soundly on my pillow,</p>

            <p>My conscience would not sting,</p>

            <p>And on each surging billow</p>

            <p>Of life I'd sit and sing.</p>

            <p>None like me for a steerer,</p>

            <p>Then moralists would see;</p>

            <p>For no jiber nor no jeerer,</p>

            <p>My fancy ever strong.</p>

            <p>Earth would delight to have me,</p>

            <p>I'd then be no outcast,</p>

            <p>Heaven with joy would save me,</p>

            <p>And lead me home at last.</p>

SQUACH-The noise a hare makes when a killing. SQUEEF-A blackguard; one who rails against women, and yet is fain to seduce them.

            <p>STANE-CHACKER-The bird stone-chatter, for why, it keeps chattering about rocks, and old stone walls. This bird is much detested in the country, because it is said to be "hatched by the toad." The tade clocks the stane-chacker's eggs, is the phrase, which may be partly true, as the toad <pb n="436" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />is often found in its nest, for they make their nests both in one hole. It is singular such a beautiful bird should be naturally fond of the toad's dirty mansion; but so it is. I have seen a fair and good-looking young man toy with one lovely female after another, until his gay season fled, and espousing at last an old harridan, verifying the adage, "that he wha is ill to please will land in the dirt at last.” Now, though the toad may be often found in this bird's nest, yet its body is of too cold a nature to hatch its eggs. In the country they look at this bird with the same sensations, almost, that they do at a female prostitute; they imagine it chatters the following rhyme, and its injunctions are obeyed :</p>

            <p>"Stane Chack, devil tak'</p>

            <p>"They wha herrie my nest,</p>

            <p>"Will never rest, will meet the pest,</p>

            <p>STAPPLES-Thatch made in handfuls, for thatching. STARN. A small quantity of any thing; same with syne. STAR O' DUNGYLE.-A few years ago, the most beautiful woman in Galloway was a Miss H- .; her father was a laird. Keltonhill fair was often by her laid in dust and ashes, for no girl was looked at or admired in all the fair but Miss H- -. The celebrated Maggy Lauder never so much attracted the attention of the crowds in Anster Loan, whatever Tennant may say to the contrary. Many and many a Rob the Ranter had she; her features ran exactly in the curve of exquisite beauty, and were always kept in the most enchanting animation; her eyes, her hair, <pb n="437" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA437#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />her lips, were the most charming objects man could behold-they set the most callous a burning with love! every movement she made was of the most attracting and engaging nature. The Irish.men from Ballinasloe would have left both their horses and oxen, and joined the crowd that followed Miss H, bawling out. "By Japers, she's the game; O! honey, if I had thee but at the sweet town of Limavadie;" another," By the Long bridge of Belfast, Barney's eyes never saw such a girl; I'd fight for her with my mother of the sloe, till all the bones in my body were bettled to mummy." The sons of John Bull beyond the Tweed, got also enamoured of Miss H———; but the good boxer or bruiser were the only persons who could get to speak to her, and she was always fonder of that class, than of well-bred rich-dressed gentlemen. In short, for all her beauty and elegance, the low and mean were her associates, and she cared not what length she went with them almost; would lay in barns with them. at night, put on beggar weeds, and bade farewell to virtue altogether, and bore to some of them bastard children: yet, for all this, wherever she appeared in proper array, all Galloway was charmed with the lovely Miss HBeauty of the very first order, in defiance of vice, brought her always crowds of admirers, who obeyed every nod of her head, every wave of her hand: her sway was truly despotic in the world of gallantry. A strong blacksmith, who could not get her entirely to himself, got so mortified, that he would off, and perish in the wilderness of Canada for her sake; away he went to the banks of Lake Huron, but was not there long before a letter followed him from Miss H, inviting to return again to Galloway, and she would assuredly marry him. Back over the Atlantic the son of Vulcan came, true to her mandate; but alas! how must he have been deceived when the dear Miss H— disdained to look or to speak to him? Thus she wielded <pb n="438" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA438#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />the sceptre of love! He afterwards became a gamekeeper, and she really married an old cattle dealer, who had weeped about her many years; to him she acted the part of not a bad wife-had a family-is yet living; but, like the celebrated Mary of Buttermere, the beauty of Cumberland, her beauty hath entirely fled her; she will be remembered in Galloway not only by the songs of her Laureates, but by hundreds of others, years unseen yet; her popular name was, "The Star of Dungyle."</p>

            <p>The following verses were supposed to have been sung by her lover, the blacksmith, when coming back over the ocean.</p>

            <p>For thee, my dear Miss H-,</p>

            <p>I'll ride out owre the roaring sea;</p>

            <p>O! happy will be Gerron</p>

Thin-sown corn on good land is said to spread by stowling. STOWRE.-Dust.

            <p>TA'END-When schoolboys catch one another in their games, they lay their hands on the heads of the one caught; this ceremony is termed taening or taking: ą catcher has often more trouble in doing this, than in catching.

Like his brother, he is a poet, and one too of considerable pith; his strain is ratherly comic, that of Allan's melancholy. Mr. T. could write a famous comedy would he try it, but like the great writers of the age, he detests the stage. It is to be hoped that he will give us another " She stoops to Conquer;" no present writer, perhaps, could do this much better, he having at command such a fund of contented humour, and an extent of information respecting the ways of the world which is endless.</p>

            <p>TEEVOO-A young man who flashes about with ladies, but has no great affection for them; one who learns the rules of affectation, who sweetheart's with warmness seemingly; who goes a larking as others do, but never feels the genuine throbs of love with him it is as the play actors say, "All my eye and Betty Martin."</p>

They were brought under this bondage first when mills in the country were rare, when a few lairds subscribed to build and uphold a mill.

            <p>THOW-Thaw. Thow-hole, a name for the south, for the wind generally blows out of the south in the time of a thaw</p>

            <p>But frost out o' the thow-hole.</p>

            <p>Indeed, frost, when the wind blows from the south, is most severe with cold of any from any other quarter; it is an unnatural cold.</p>

            <p>THREAD O' BLUE-Any little smutty touch in song-singing, chatting, or piece of writing; perhaps there may be a few in this book, but if modesty is not absolutely insulted, these, if not too gross, are not fraught with much harm all works which stand the test of ages are not free of these threads, even the Bible itself is not clear. When nature is followed close, it is almost impossible to avoid themO! they who feel the pith and flame Of manly strength, obtaineth fame, Who look to neither left nor right, But dash on forward, full of might; Who scorn to take a hint, a plan, From humble creature-mortal man, Feel those delights felt by the brave, Who scorn like hell the sorry slave, Who for themselves will ever think, And do the will in prose or clink, Which still shall be the way with me, Though poor or rich, I shall be free.</p>

            <p>THRIDD-Third.</p>

            <p>"Twa part and thridd,” the two-thirds of any thing; anciently, the quarter-staff was held "twapart and thridd," one-third part of it beneath hand, the other two-thirds above. Thus the way, when—</p>

            <p>THRYST-A promise to do any thing, a kind of vow; to set a thryst, to make a promise to perform something at a certain place and time : a young man and an old maid once set a thryst to meet one evening, and have some private confab with other in a glen; she was punctual to the hour, and so he, but his intentions were different from her's; kept himself concealed, to observe her motions, while she longed to behold him; at length, despairing of his appearance, she uttered the following, in great wrath—</p>

            <p>"O! Rab, O! Rab, shal't thou make me sab,</p>

            <p>THROWING the HOSHEN-At weddings, when the time of</p>

            <p>bedding comes on, the young fowk are surrounded by the</p>

            <p>people at the wedding, to witness the ceremony; one part</p>

            <p>of which is, that the bride takes the stocking off her left</p>

            <p>leg, and flings it at random amongst the crowd, and who-</p>

            <p>ever it happens to hit will be the first of them who will</p>

            <p>get married. This custom prevails too in Ireland; see the</p>

            <p>song of Paddy's Wedding, O. While on this subject, I</p>

            <p>may mention a thing connected with wedlock, which is not</p>

            <p>very well known in the middle parts of Galloway, but</p>

            <p>common away by the border. When a young woman gets a</p>

            <p>husband before her sister, who is older, this sister, at her</p>

            <p>wedding, must dance without shoes on her feet.</p>

            <p>In a</p>

            <p>Of all the songs and poems belonging to the south of Scotland which have come through my rummaging hand, (and many a worthy bunch have), not any of female composition have taken my taste half so much as those of the young lady lately mentioned; and though modesty holds my tongue from telling her name, I cannot refrain from letting the world have a little peep at her poetic talents, which, if cultivated perhaps a little more, bid fair for giving Scotland another Miss Bailly, or one with power equal to her, though directed in quite a different way.

            <p>TIGG-TOW-To touch and go, to be off and on, neither serious nor merry; to tigg-tow wi a lass, to seem inclined to marry her, yet to hang off; it is a shame to use females so; to run lengths with them, and then come retrograde. To tigg-tow with talents, to show the world a part and keep a part, to seem to range through the regions of genius, and all of a sudden to dart into a brock-hole. "To show the fins of the dolphin," to flash whiles in silk, then hotter about in hodden grey.</p>

            <p>TILLIE-CLAY-Cold clay, unproductive soil; the heart that never felt love, is said to be a piece of tillie-clay; tillielicks, taunts and sneers.</p>

TOD-TYKES-Dogs half foxes, half common dogs; shepherds tether their het bitches about fox-haunts, and so this breed of dogs is acquired; they are said to be excellent hunters. Tod-tracks, the traces of the fox's feet in snow; <pb n="450" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA450#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />he is such a regular walking animal, that by the marks of his feet he seems to have but two, for why, he sets his hind feet exactly in the tracks of the fore ones. Tod-touzing, the Scottish method of hunting the fox, by shooting, bustling, guarding, halloaing, &amp;c. famous fun, without a regular plan.</p>

            <p>TOMERALL-A horse two years old; a young cout or staig. TOOM-SKIN'D-Hungry; a person so is said to be toom</p>

            <p>skin'd; toom, empty; tommacks, little hillocks; to toom out, to pour out, to make empty.</p>

            <p>TOORRIN-Hay is said to be toorrin, when it rises on the rake in raking; a fire is also said to be so when blazing freely. Torrish, a dairy-maid's term to the cows when she wishes them to stand still.</p>

            <p>Toor-To drink; to toot over, to drink over; toot, to sound a horn, or the sound of a horn. TOOTIN-HORN-A bullock's horn, with the heart out of it, used for blowing or "tootin" through, about some farm-houses; these horns are much in use in the harvesttime, such as about meal-times, and create some hilarity. Two Scotch soldiers having got a month's furlough from their regiment, quartered somewhere in England, to go and see their friends beyond the Tweed, set off from the barracks in high spirits; but alas! poor fellows, before they had journied far to the north, poverty beset them, "and the devil and all his witches danced in their poor pouches." No manner of relief then could they find, but to sing undernight for "baw bees" in the large towns on their way; and it was all they were able this way to procure as much cash as keeped in the life; for one of them could sing little or none, and the other was not good at it. However, the one who could not sing was a trumpeter, and by good luck had his "tootin-horn" with him, which often got them a dinner, when sharply beset with hunger. One night, though, as they were reposing themselves in a barn in the neighbourhood of Kendal, they felt their stomachs <pb n="451" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA451#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />a-biting confoundedly, and were just on the point of starting and catching the first thing of food kind they would meet with, exclaiming, "they wha winna ficht for their meat, winna ficht for their king;" when the barn-door was flung open, and a large party of people entered, who instantly struck up lights, and loaded a long table they brought in with various viands of luscious dainties, the "imry" of which went up the noses of the red-coated lads like electricity. This was a religious sect, somewhat of the epicurean order, who mingled eating, drinking, and other good cheer with their holy concerns. The lads lay in the straw as quiet as mice in a mill, and observed their movements; one of the club got on his legs, and harangued at no small rate, with a loud voice, rounding his sentences always with these words, "When the archangel shall sound the last and awful trumpet:" our soldiers hearing this, the singer of them muttered to his comrade, the trumpeter, "gie them a toot man, Tam, whan he says that again." Tam agreed, and just as the preacher was concluding one of his long breaths as before, the trumpeter sounded one of his marches, in its highest key, when out of the house rolled the congregation, in the utmost disorder, leaving behind them the whole of the untasted feast to the famished soldiers, who leaped from the straw, welcoming the same in the most gracious manner. And after they had bounded their sides for once with the fat of the land, they crammed full their knapsacks, and went whistling away, rejoicing, "Blue Bonnets owre the Border;" not forgetting, for many a long day afterwards, the good turn of the tootin-horn.</p>

            <p>TOSHOCH-A comfortable looking young person, from tosh, happy.</p>

            <p>TOVIE-The same with tozie, warm and comfortable; blowzie-looking, with drinking warm drink.</p>

            <p>TRAPP-To trip, to catch another reading wrong.</p>

            <p>TRAVISH-To carry after a trailing manner.</p>

            <p>TROGG-Old clothes; troggers, persons who gather old clothes, Gallovidian Jews. It is somewhat strange there are none of the children of Israel crying "Auld cloe! cloe!" through any town in Britain but London. TROLLIEBAGS.-The inwards of animals.</p>

            <p>TRONE.-A trowle, a masonic instrument; tronnie, a boy who plays the truant.</p>

            <p>TROTTER O' NEW GALLOWA.-Mr. Trotter, son of Dr. Trotter, the famous muir doctor in his day, and brother of Miss Trotter, author of her worthy father's life. Lately Mr. T. published some rustic Gallovidian tales, the which I am very far from disliking, though I have <pb n="453" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA453#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />heard them railed against; they are homely, told ina half poetic, half Ossianic strain, and contain contented feelings. So far as I think, Mr. T. is a gentleman, whom the world's cares sit lightly on, and I am glad to think so; his little book will be more relished sometime after this than it is at present. Rusticity is of slow but steady growth; as to his sister, I hope she will not lay aside her pen; wherever I be she may rely on me, a steady, though unknown friend; the book on Heraldry, I do not know how it may do, but success to trade. There is some gentleman too, besides Mr. Trotter, in the Moorlands, who publishes books, but without his name. I believe that is Barbour of Bogue; what is he afraid about? Is it in the nature of Hillmen to shrink? no, no. There is no occasion, now-a-days, Mr. B. to skulk; come boldly forward, fool or no fool; this is not the season of time to slumber in a corner and wait for patrons, for the days of patrons are over, and it is as well. "Let us trust in our own strength;" when a man lays his shoulder to the work, he is seldom overcome; then the glory of buffeting the ocean of adversity, single-handed industry is before all interest, the very essence of independence. The tales of his are tolerable, though methinks, not just so much as Mr. Trotter's, the one has more fancy than the other.</p>

            <p>TRUCKERY. The porcelain stuff attending the tea-table. TRUFF. A turf; trumf, trump, at cards.</p>

            <p>TUE.-Fatigued; tued, fatigued out; tueg, to tug.</p>

            <p>TUSKY. A person with large tusks or teeth. An old man had lost all his teeth but one large one in the under jaw; had moreover been a gourmand all his life, and was one day observed at a large dinner, mumbling and bolting <pb n="454" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA454#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />away as fast as he was able, until a large bite or pellet of half chewed beef stuck in his throat; frightfully his eyes stood in his head, one ran behind and struck him ‘a smart blow between the shoulders, (the best way thought to be on these choaking occasions) out bounded the beef; but alas! a thread of it had been wound round the solitary tusk, which was the cause of it sticking in the gullet, and was also the cause of dragging the long fang from a station it had graced many years, to the secret smiles of the party.</p>

            <p>TWAFAUL.-Twofold; twa hand crack, a familiar discourse between two.</p>

            <p>TWELLIE.-A dispute, a tulzie; tweezars, hair curlers; tweest, to twist.</p>

            <p>UNCOES.-Things uncommon.</p>

            <p>UNDERTHOUM.-A little trick projected in secret, is said to be done under thoum, underfit peats. Peat turf, digged beneath the foot, not in the common way of cutting them of a breest.</p>

            <p>UPPLAN SHOWERS.-Moorland rains; much more rain always falls on the moors than in the dale; mountains attract clouds, then their tops like daggers stab them, and down foam the black torrents.</p>

            <p>-</p>

            <p>UPPLE. When the weather at any time has been wet, and ceases to be so, we say it is uppled; now this is from upheld, or it is the same; the sky is held up, here do we see lift, carry, and upple, all connected together, all <pb n="455" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA455#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />proceeding from one cause, the which I have already explained, in articles Lift and Carry.</p>

            <p>URE. A kind of coloured haze, which the sun-beams make in the summer time, in passing through; that moisture which the sun exhales from the land and ocean; the appearance is most obvious on the sea, and when very dry weather, on the moors; when such is seen, it is called the dry ure:</p>

            <p>"The east was blae, dry ure bespread the hills,</p>

            <p>"And gizzend hang on charule pins, the mills."</p>

            <p>VENTERS. Any thing which the wind or tide drive in from the ocean upon a shore; they are termed so from " venture," because people have often to venture, or risk their lives in obtaining them; for when a junk of shipwreck, or other drift wood, gets into the surf of a rock-bound shore, the rude "venterers" catch hold when the prey comes within reach, and are dragged by the rebounding waves into the deep, and so left to perish in the turbulent brine. This is often the case; and those who are so unfortunate, never cause many tears to be shed by the living for their sake, they are never lamented for; as it was a greedy and savage disposition which hurried them to destruction, else they would never have taken such a death-grasp of (very often) a poor prize. Persons living by shores who happen to get rich, are always suspected to have "made themselves up," by gaining rich venters, such as trunks full of cash, pipes of wine, or casks of brandy, but this, when sounded to the bottom, is often not <pb n="456" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA456#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />true, and that their weighty purses have been filled some other more honorable way. There are many who make a practice indeed of "rinning the shores" of the south of Scotland: but where will we find one of these who is not a poverty-struck looking creature? By a time perhaps, a windlass-barr, or a deal of some kind or other, may be caught, but for once any thing is found, twenty times nothing is got; and they would find themselves and their families much better off were they to stay at home and look after more sure matters, though this advice will seldom be taken. An old fellow who lived about the shore, once said "that he wad rather rin roun the craigs, and look out for something, wi' a north wun blawin, than stay ahame wi' Mall the wife;" his luck indeed, might have been a little "snell wi' the tongue," as some others are; yet, had he run the shore less, and been thronger some other way, he would, maybe, have met with a fuller hut than he once had, and a quieter spouse-"ateen." But what signifies all the trade of centers, which goes on about the south shores of Scotland, compared to that of other places, and chiefly the west of Ireland? There the gulf stream disgorges what it takes into its maw in its retrograde range athwart the broad Atlantic. And there, as the darling poet Falconer says "Hell hounds prowl along the shore." No savages on earth are worse than these. No New Zealanders, nor Africans, are so bloody and base. When a ship in distress is driven about that infernal strand, as many are, it is not the bark the sailors try to save, but their lives, and often are they stripped naked, and inhumanly murdered by these detestable wretches. O! Erin, I weep for this, of thee. O! rulers, why are ye thus blind? Plant on these inhospitable shores, a power to protect our brave seamen, the guards of our liberties, and the foundation of our nation's riches and honour.</p>

            <p>VOUTS.-Vaults; burial places of the rich-" where those above the vulgar born do rot in state;" also any arched roof place under ground. One of these, at the auld Abbey of Glenluce, contains the famous library of Michael Scott, <pb n="458" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA458#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />the Warlock. Here are thousands of old witch songs and incantations, books of the Black Art and Necromancy, Philosophy of the Devil, Satan's Almanacks, the Fire Spangs of Faustus, the Soothsayer's Creed, the Witch Chronicle, and the Black Cluds wyme laid open, with many more valuable volumes. None but priests above four-score are admitted entrance to this sacred archive; and if they take down a volume from one side of the library and set it on the other, when they return, it is found brought back to its place, planted exactly on its own skelf. Moreover, when they find a book they would wish to take home with them, and peruse quietly by the fire side, if it is put in the pocket, or under the oxter, when they get back to the Manse the book is vanished; the invisible librarian, like those impudent ones in the Edinburgh College Library, will allow no book of worth to be read in private, not for any deposit. A priest went once to it, as some go to that of the British Museum, with the intention to copy, alias cabbage; and after he had spent a whole day noting down some of the dark mystics of Masonry, he hied him home, called the wife to read her the treat, but alas! when he opened the copy, there lay the paper as white as if pen had never been laid on it, which much enraged the reverend Cowan. VowL.-People playing at cards have their terms; and this</p>

            <p>vowl is one of them. When one of the parties playing gets nothing, not so much as a trick, then they are said to be vowl'd-this and sutter'd are one; and a vowl is said to be worth nine games. This is something like that saying, or taylor's skit-that it takes nineteen taylors, a bull-dog, and a tippeny brick, to make a man. The chief Galloway games at cards are, Catch the Ten, or Catch Honours, Lent for Beans, Brag and Pairs for Slaes, Beggar my Neebour, Birkie, Love after Supper, and Wha to be married first. These are the genuine rustic games; but lately <pb n="459" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA459#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />Whist, Cribbage, and other genteel nonsense, hath been introduced.

            <p>WADDINGS.-Weddings.</p>

            <p>These ceremonies are not so largely attended as in the days of yore; auld wives tell me, that the Spirit o' Waddings is left the country; now sic a thing is slippet by in a prevet way, and a body never gets the thrapple watted owre them. Wadding-baws, money tossed among mobs by wedding people. Wadding-braws, dresses for marriage; the buying of these braws is a serious matter, for this is the first time the young fowk appear in public. Wadding sarks, the bride, previous to marriage, makes the bridegroom a shirt, these shirt are termed <pb n="460" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA460#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />wadding sarks. A peasant once told me, "That he ance did na intend to take Meg for a wife, but the cutty saw this, flew to my neck, and measured the sark, and than I was obliged to tak her." Waddings o' Craws, large flocks of rooks, particularly when in "blackened train,' they fly at eve to "their repose."</p>

            <p>WADDS AND THE WEARS.-One of the most celebrated amuscments of the ingle-ring. I believe Mr. Cromek has touched at it slightly in his Nithsdale and Galloway song; yet ample room is left for a description of it by me, without being called a plagiarist. To begin then, one in the ring speaks as follows:</p>

            <p>"I hae been awa at the wadds and the wears</p>

            <p>"These seven lang years;</p>

            <p>"And's come hame a puir broken ploughman;</p>

            <p>"What will ye gie me to help me to my trade?"</p>

            <p>He may either say he's a "pair broken ploughman," or any other trade; but since he has chosen that trade, some of the articles belonging to it must always be given or offercd, in order to recruit him. But the article he most wants he privately tells one of the party, who is not allowed, of course, to offer him any thing, as he knows the thing, which will throw the offerer in a wadd, and must be avoided as much as possible for to be in a wadd, is a very serious matter, as shall afterwards be explained. Now, the one on the left hand of the poor ploughman, makes ¿ the first offer, by way of answer to what above was said; "I'll gie ye the coutter to help ye to your trade." The ploughman answers, "I don't thank ye for your coulter, I hae ane already." Then another offers him another article belonging to the ploughman's business, such as the moolbred, but this also is refused; another, perhaps, gives the sock, another the stilts, another the spattle, another the <pb n="461" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA461#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />naigs, another the naig-graith, and so on; until one gives the soam, which was the article he most wanted; and was the thing secretly told to one, and is the thing that throws the giver into a wadd, out of which he is relieved in the following manner :</p>

            <p>The ploughman says to the one in the wadd, whether will ye hae three questions and two commands, or three commands and two questions, to answer or gang on wi', sae that ye may win out o' the wadd?" For the one so fixed has always the choice which of these alternatives to take. Suppose he takes the first, two commands and three questions, then a specimen of these may run</p>

            <p>"I command ye to kiss the crook," says the ploughman, which must be completely obeyed by the one in the wadd-his naked lips must salute the sooty implement.</p>

            <p>Secondly, saith the ploughman, I command ye to stand up in that neuk, and say</p>

            <p>"Here stan I, as stiff's a stake,</p>

            <p>"Wha 'ill kiss me for pity's sake?"</p>

            <p>Which must also be done; in a corner of the house must he stand and repeat that couplet, till some tender-hearted lass relieves him. Now for the questions, which are most deeply laid, or so touching to him, that he finds much difficulty to answer them.</p>

            <p>Firstly, then; "Suppose ye were in a bed with Maggie Lowden and Jennie Logan, your twa great sweet-hearts, what ane o'm wad ye ding owre the bed side, and what ane wad ye turn to and clap and cuddle?" He makes answer by choosing Maggie Lowden, perhaps, to the great mirth of the party.</p>

            <p>Secondly, then, Suppose ye were stanin stark naked on the tap o' Cairnhattie, whether wad ye cry on Peggie Kirtle or Nell o' Killimingie to come wi' yer claise?' He answers again in a similar manner.</p>

            <pb n="462" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA462#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>Lastly, then, "Suppose ye were in a boat wi' Tibbie Tait, Mary Kairnie, Sallie Snadrap, and Kate o’Minnieive, and it was to coup wi' ye, what ane o'em wad ye sink? what ane wad ye soom? wha wad ye bring to lan'? and wha wad ye marry?" Then he answers again, to the fun of the company, perhaps in this way, "I wad sink Mary Kairnie, soom Tibbie Tait, bring Sallie Snadrap aneath my oxter to lan', and marry sweet Kattie o' Minnieive.”</p>

            <p>And so ends that bout at the wadds and the wears, to give place to Hey Willie Wine and How Willie Wine, or the Dambrod and Legendary stories. WAMPUZ-To make curvilinear dashes, like a large fish in the water.</p>

            <p>WANTER-A bachelor, for why, he wants a wife.</p>

            <p>WAPP-To wrestle; wapping, wrestling.</p>

            <p>WARBLE-A short thick worm, which lodges between the skin and the fell of black cattle, not between the fell and the flesh; a little hole leads to them, and, like the West India jeeger, may be squeezed and picked out.

            <p>O, Willie, had'st thou stay'd at home,</p>

            <p>WARROCHING Wallowing, struggling, like a creature lairing in mud.</p>

            <p>WARSH-Fresh tasted, requiring salt; warsle, a wrestle. WARTS-Little wens, said to be eradicated by washing with swine's blood, or straiking with a dead man's hand. WASPET-A man is said to look waspet, when he is got small at the wazban o' the breeks, something like a wasp or pishminnie, when he fills not his wast-coat well; as after marriage, and such serious affairs. WASSOCKS-A kind of turban the milkmaids carry their</p>

            <p>pails, or stoups on their head; also a kind of bunch put on a boring jumper, to hinder the water required in boring from leaping up into the quarriers' eyes. WASTCOAT-Waistcoat, vest, &amp;c. It is said that a doctor once told the wonderful Burns, that if he left not off taking whisky, he would soon be in the dust, for that the coat of his heart was brunt off with it already. "O," quoth the bard, "let wastcoat and a' gang, ay maun I prie the barly-bree." Respecting Burns, when in Auld Reekie, I visited Johnnie Dowie's yill-house, famous for being a haunt of the poet's, and for selling good brown stout; <pb n="464" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA464#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />scarcely had I sat down in the Coffin Room, before the following verses were struck off. I am no poet, as my readers well see, though I have been a rhymer from my first, and liketh by a time to try it. "What good can come from Galloway?" saith Hogg, the Etterick Shepherd, in his Queen's Wake. Ay, his bardship damns all Galloway, because a Gallovidian; a Mr. Morrison parodied him and his Wake, in a poem. Poor spite! but to my work; let that be good or no, it matters little to me, as I prefer putting up with injuries, rather than be "A plague to them who'd be a plague to me."</p>

            <p>Verses which occurred to me in the queer tavern of Johnnie Dowie's, a house much haunted by Burns, while in Auld Reekie :</p>

WEATHERGAWA very singular object seen in a cloudy sky, when a certain kind of weather rules it. The rainbow and it seem to be of one nature, and to proceed from the same cause. The beautiful colours in the weathergam, however, are stronger defined, of a deeper hue <pb n="468" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA468#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />than those of the rainbow; the back ground of the wed thergaw, as it were, is always a black cloud, and instead of being the segment of a circle, is, so far as it appears, a straight line. The whole seems to be the refraction of the sun's rays, owing to their beaming on a column of water, falling in the form of weighty rain, from one region of a dense atmosphere to another. Thus this strange appearance is termed by rustic Scottish naturalists the weathergaw, or the gall of the weather; and when the gall or gaw, bursts, woe be to the tenants of the field, down come the sumps, and wild foam the spates; however, it sometimes indicates good weather, like the ark o' the cluds, from its situation in the sky; thus when the ark runs north and south, the aftercome is not so much dreaded, as if it had stretched between any other airts o' the lift, and when the weathergaw is seen in the east, its consequences by the weatherwise are less dreaded, though east rains, when they do fall, are the dreighest of any :</p>

            <p>"The weather's taking up now,</p>

            <p>"For yonder is the weathergaw, "How bonny in the east now,</p>

            <p>"Now the colours fade awa;</p>

            <p>"But turn your head tae south man,</p>

            <p>WEE.-Small, little; wee, wee, smaller than small:</p>

            <p>"I wuss I had a wee, wee house,</p>

            <p>"A wee, wee cat, to catch a mouse,</p>

            <p>“And you to rule them a"."</p>

            <p>Popular song.'</p>

            <p>WEEL. Well. Weel man. A common salutation; weelfaurd, well-favoured, good-looking.</p>

            <p>WEE Ross. One of the best known islands belonging Galloway; it stands at the mouth of the Dee, and is about two miles in circumference; the Isle of Heston, in <pb n="469" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA469#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />the Bay of Balcarry, is about the same size, and swarms with rabbits; there are none of these animals on the Wee Ross, but there are plenty of rats, which burrow amongst the rocks, and live on partons, pirr-eggs, &amp;c.; it is called the Wee Ross, because the bold headland, termed the Big Ross, is right beside it, and forms, from its height, a famous land-mark for sailors; between the two lands is a rock, termed Janet Richardson. This was a poor woman who belonged to Clauchendolly, and who went on to the rock at ebb-tide, to gather a powkfu' o' mussles; while so employed the sea flowed round the rock, unobserved by her, at length noticing it-she "kilted up her coats, aboou the na'el," as the saying is, plunged in, but the buldering waters of the sound hurried her off her feckless shanks, but she having a farkage o' claise about her, they keeped her aboon broe, until she was driven ashore on the Milton Lands; from such circumstance is the rock named, and that name will likely remain as long as if it had been given by Cook or Parry. On the Wee Ross stands two land-marks, erected by the wisdom of Skipper Skellie; they point out to sailors the land's lead, and the Dee's Channel. I must not pass this worthy Skipper Skellie, slightly; his honest, and feeling mind has been exerted in behalf of the sailors, a class of men, perhaps as much respected as any on earth, and apparently for good cause. Whatever the skipper sees he can do for them, that he doth, even to hurting himself; his daring mind is backed out by that of every wise man's, and all his plans have originality and good in them; well may [ term him the Gallovidian marine engineer, for the same reason that I term Gladstone that of the land. After his land marks were built, a curious poet fancied he addressed them thus:</p>

            <p>Some time ago when I was wont to cross,</p>

            <p>The Solway Firth, and trade in coal and lime,</p>

            <p>Often I've found myself at no small loss,</p>

            <p>To know the Dee in many a stormy time;</p>

            <p>Deep rolling river always grand sublime,</p>

            <p>From others stagnant, full of sludge and dross,</p>

            <p>Which vomit round it in the sea their slime,</p>

            <p>"Twas then methought that from these jumbling gross,</p>

            <p>Skelly should mark it yet upon the Little Ross.</p>

            <p>So I with you, ye brothers square and high,</p>

            <p>Have had my wish, I glory in your birth,</p>

            <p>Stand unscar'd beneath the sulky sky,</p>

            <p>Let growling surfs and surges give ye mirth,</p>

            <p>Smile at Kirkcudbright, graze across the Firth;</p>

            <p>Unsmelted will around her axle fly,</p>

            <p>Tho' still remember, Skelly, who am I.</p>

            <p>Whene'er a sailor from the offin hails,</p>

            <p>Your lofty lordships boldly answer he,</p>

            <p>"Come hither from the gale, ye tar who sails,</p>

            <p>"Along the wild bosom of the wrathful sea,</p>

            <p>"If for a shelter you incline to be,</p>

            <p>"Within our arms is one which never fails,</p>

            <p>"Through gurly hurricanes to form a lee,</p>

            <p>"Where pitching ceases, where no anchor trails,</p>

            <p>"Give Skellie's orders then, when ocean rails.”</p>

            <p>Whoe're can lie and snore upon the pillow,</p>

            <p>And seamen weltring round in great distress,</p>

            <p>Bawling for mercy, struggling with the billow,</p>

            <p>Will surely ne'er behold the land of bliss;</p>

            <p>Contentment's lips thee'ill never, never kiss,</p>

            <p>But will be scourg'd by some infernal fellow,</p>

            <p>For such as these the devil cannot miss,</p>

            <p>Oh, help the weather-beaten sailor, will ye,</p>

            <p>May commerce flutter up our lovely river,</p>

            <p>And fright the grass from off the untrod street,</p>

            <p>May spirit, sense, and worth, forsake us never,</p>

            <p>Let who are foes shake hands, and friendly meet,</p>

            <p>Who brews the venom, may that venom's fever,</p>

            <p>When I must sink at last, through tear and wear,</p>

            <p>Beneath the sod in death's cold arms of ice,</p>

            <p>Beside this isle is a tolerable place for ships to anchor in, when they come from off the sea, at a wrong time of the tide, and must wait for water flowing of depth, to swim them up the river. However, if the storm be a hurricane, the shelter is not so great, and it requires a ship with the best holding tackle to ride secure, About two years ago, five ships were torn from their moorings there by an awful gale, and dashed to pieces on the Bar; one of these was commanded by a young man belonging to Cumberland, of the best disposition and manners; his loss was so deeply lamented both in England and Scotland, that the following true song was produced on the subject :</p>

            <p>CAPTAIN ORMONBY.</p>

            <p>Sweet maidens fair in Cumberland, what griefs have I to tell,</p>

            <p>The dear young Captain Ormonby, who loved ye all so well,</p>

            <p>Is over-whelmed with the storm, is sunk beneath the wave,</p>

            <p>In the wild deep, there he doth sleep, there is his watery grave.</p>

            <p>He left your shores for Dublin-bay with a deep-laden bark,</p>

            <p>The day was fine, the wind was fair, and sweetly sang the lark,</p>

            <p>But ere the sun stood north and south, the sky was all o'ercast,</p>

            <p>And by Blackcoomb, with awful boom, came roaring on the blast.</p>

            <p>The surges o'er the head-lands rose, and buried every mool,</p>

            <p>The Isle of Man they seem'd to sink, and break out o'er Burool;</p>

            <p>What ship could stand such billows vast, she must run for a lee,</p>

            <p>With naked masts, before the blasts, forlorn she on must flee?</p>

            <p>So on did steer young Ormonby before the furious wind,</p>

            <p>The tide being out along the shores, no harbour could he find;</p>

            <p>The little Ross no shelter was, the anchors would not hold,</p>

            <p>So our noble tar, upon the Bar, among the foam was roll'd.</p>

            <p>Up high his brig was heaved whiles by the tremendous sea,</p>

            <p>Then down again, with thundering sound, upon the sands of Dee;</p>

            <p>But soon she stove, and soon she sunk, the sailors stood aghast,</p>

            <p>Then, for the live did climb and strive to save't upon the mast.</p>

            <p>As on the main-top they did cling, and gazing all around,</p>

            <p>Four other ships, besides themselves, were on the stormy ground;</p>

            <p>"What shall we do?" a sailor cried, "lo, yonder's one upset,</p>

            <p>"Altho' dry land be near at hand, to it we'll never get."</p>

            <p>"The tide will flow by six o'clock (the captain then did say),</p>

            <p>"And down will fall our only hope, this mast here will give way;</p>

            <p>"There's not a chance that we'll be saved, no, not a chance for one,</p>

            <p>"No boat can live, none help can give, we're drowned every man."</p>

            <pb n="472" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA472#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>“O! let us, since we see our fate, to the Almighty pray,</p>

            <p>"Implore him for to save our souls, and pot cast them away;</p>

            <p>"For soon my brother sufferers dear before him they will be,</p>

            <p>"For death doth ride upon the tide, this awful night we see.'</p>

            <p>But scarcely had good Ormonby sooth'd his desponding crew,</p>

            <p>When down the mast with crashing fell, the surges o'er them flew;</p>

            <p>Their shrieks were stifled with the storm, the waters mad did roar,</p>

            <p>And dash'd them down, to gasp and drown, and never to rise more.</p>

            <p>Poor Bill, 'ere this an hardy tar, who had sail'd many a sea</p>

            <p>A hunting whales among the ice, and slaves by hot Goree;</p>

            <p>Reach'd the fore-mast with trouble great, and saw the horrid fate</p>

            <p>Which did befal his mess-mates all, for him but to relate.</p>

            <p>And while poor Bill did tell the tale, with sorrow he did weep,</p>

            <p>“My kind young captain,” he did cry, “ is buried in the deep;</p>

            <p>""Tis thirty years now, since a boy, I first did sail the sea,</p>

            <p>"And I've ne'er had, such a good lad, a master over me.”</p>

            <p>Lament then for this worthy youth all who have hearts can feel,</p>

            <p>His sweetheart's breast is wounded deep, we fear 'twill never heal;</p>

            <p>On Whitehaven Quay she parted that morn with her true love,</p>

            <p>No more to see, nor with him be till she's in Heaven above.</p>

            <p>Well mayst thou moan thou Ocean now, upon the Milton sand, For Ormonby thou hast devoured, what can thy wrath withstand? The tall black rocks around thy shores, even totter with thy rage, So how then can, the art of man, with thee in war engage?</p>

            <p>O! sing this song, my sailors all, when you're in mournful mood, And think on the distresses great your brethren whiles have stood; Be still prepared to meet the storm, be still prepared to drown, So then will ye, like Ormonby, gain an eternal crown.</p>

            <p>WEHAW!-A cry which displeases horses. Boys are frequently seen about the clauchans running after auld naigs, and crying wehaw! and see how the old horses scool, hang their lugs, and would kick were they able. WHAILING-To get a lashing with a rope's end. This comes from the name of a rope called a whale-line, used in fishing for whales.</p>

            <p>WHANG-Any thing of a long supple nature. A whang o' cheese, as much cheese as can wag. A whang o' tobacco, whangs for steekers to shoon, &amp;c., are all of the same order. Whang, however, is also a blow, or ratherly a lash with a whip; this blow is sometimes called whack.</p>

            <p>WHAUKY-Whisky; the same with Aqua.</p>

            <pb n="473" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA473#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>WHAUP-Bird curlew; also a twist, as in a rope. Thus, whaup i'the rape, a doubling, a back-spang, a quirk, to deceive. Wheeple, to whistle like a whaup.</p>

            <p>WHEESHT-An order for silence. Haud your wheesht, be silent.</p>

            <p>WHEEZAN-The noise carriage-wheels make, when moving</p>

            <p>fast.</p>

            <p>WHIGG-Sour cream, a pleasant acid to the taste.</p>

            <p>WHIHE-The sound of an adder; her fuffing noise, when angered,</p>

            <p>WHILLIE BILLOU-A noisy commotion, as when the for is up, started for chace. French, Whirlie Breelow, for</p>

            <p>the same.</p>

            <p>WHITE-To pare with a knife; also to fleetch, to flatter for favour. An auld whitie, a flatterer; the same with whitelip.</p>

            <p>WHITE HAWSE-A favourite pudding, that which conducts the food to the stomach with sheep.</p>

            <p>WHITTERING-Running about in a strange simple manner. The way a modest lover haunts his mistress; also, any thing of weak growth is a whitler.</p>

            <p>WHOMMLED-Overturned. "To be whommled beneath a</p>

            <p>bushel," to be covered by a bushel; "to be whommled by</p>

            <p>a waye," to be whelmed in the deep.</p>

            <p>WHOORLS-Circular backs for spindles-</p>

            <p>"By cauk and keel we'll win our breed,</p>

            <p>"And whoorles for spinnles in time o' need."</p>

            <p>Gaberlunzie Man.</p>

            <p>WHUDDING-Telling lies; also to run like a hare. We say, see "To bawdrons, how she whudds awa up the lee." Whudder, a curious kind of noise; we say, "a hare starts from her den wi' a whudder;" also, the wind, in a cold night, is said to whudder. Association must partly explain this term, bare words cannot do it.</p>

            <pb n="474" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA474#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />

            <p>WHUFFT-Whift. He whufft out the candle; he suddenly blew out the candle.</p>

            <p>WHULT-A blow received from a fall, or the noise attending such a fall. He gat an unco whult from falling, and he fell with an unco whult; both these are said: also whult, any thing larger than expected; a large potatoe, like a loltidoll, is termed a whulter. Loltidoll is the largest species of potatoe in the three kingdoms, the British yam; Irishmen say only two grow to a stalk, and auy one of these is as big as a child's head sixteen years ould. Our Pinkies, Mack-a-ma-riches, Benefits, Blue-nurgs, &amp;c. are trifles to these.</p>

            <p>WHULLILOW-The same with Whillie-billou.</p>

            <p>WHUMGEES-Vexatious whisperings, trivial tricks in truthtelling, as it were. Whaups in the rape, and whumgees, are not widely different. Whumper, to whimper; to whunge, to whinge, to fret.</p>

            <p>WHUNCE-A heavy blow, or the noise of such a blow, as when two channle-stones strike one another.</p>

            <p>WHUNNER-A thundering sound, or the blow which causes such a sound.</p>

            <p>WHUNS-Whins; whun-stanes, whin-stones; whun blooms, the yellow blooms of the whin. Whins, it is said, were introduced into this country from France; that the catwhun is the Scotch-whun, the other the French-whun. Now, the truth is, any bad thing, as whins are, no nation will own, so we give them to the French. The French give them again to other nations; so, what belongs to all the world, and what the world detests, no nation in the world will own, and vice versa.</p>

            <p>WHUPS-Whips; whupperin, a whipper-in amongst foxhunters; a loaded whup, a whip laden in the shaft with lead; whup, also to run; whup awa, run along. Some <pb n="475" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA475#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />may think that I give not all the strange words in use in the south of Scotland; this is true; but I give all those which none have noticed before me, at least the greater part. I once intended to give them all, but I found it would swell my book too much; those who wish to see the rest, may consult Jamieson's excellent Dictionary. And one of my motives for writing this book was to aid our Scottish Dictionary as much towards perfection as possible.</p>

            <p>WHURLIE-BIRLIE-Any thing which whirleth round; chil-</p>

            <p>dren have little toys they spin, so termed. There is no-</p>

            <p>thing so hard to make the peasantry of Scotland believe, as</p>

            <p>the truths of Astronomy; some consider the matter deeply,</p>

            <p>and instantly assent to them; but the majority are ratherly</p>

            <p>inclined to laugh at the glorious discoveries of a Pytha-</p>

            <p>goras, a Copernicus, a Kepler, and a Newton. They</p>

            <p>cannot think that this earth turns round on its axis, at all;</p>

            <p>and far less that it wheels round the sun.</p>

            <p>While reason-</p>

            <p>ing this matter with one of them one day, he gave out the</p>

            <p>There is another poem in my wallet respecting the peasantry, termed Auld Wullie Birlie, and as these poems illustrate the manners of the country people better than prose hints, I feel inclined to give it; and be it understood, when I name not the author of any piece, I want my readers to guess that, or let it alone, just as they feel:Auld Willie Birlie is ane laigh fiel' herd,</p>

            <p>And tharty years he has herded Clinkanco,'</p>

            <p>His claes are duffle, something grey his beard,</p>

            <p>And healthfu habits make him fail but slow.</p>

            <p>He trods about wi' his bit halflin trot,</p>

            <p>Ane han' bears Cloupie, tither his coat-tail,</p>

            <p>What skill has he about a murill'd stott,</p>

            <p>And croitoch'd cloots the body soon can bail.</p>

            <p>Is married to ane honest plodding chiel,</p>

            <p>Quietly has Willie lived, and sae he'll dee,</p>

            <p>He's no a melancholy wretch like me,</p>

            <p>Wi' mankind he had never ony strife.</p>

            <p>He never felt the flashing passions mad,</p>

            <p>The burning brains which nothing can assuage,</p>

            <p>The sorrowing soul that loveth to be sad,</p>

            <p>And frets for ay, like burdie in a cage,</p>

            <p>Upon ilk sunny sabbath afternoon,</p>

            <p>He reads his bible on the green brae side,</p>

            <p>And thinks about the joys in heaven aboon,</p>

            <p>And sacraments aroun' the countra wide.</p>

Whur-cocks is the call, when up flutter the birds; whiles poachers blatter at them, and the shot-lead is heard rattling on the trees. Whush also means a noise or fame; thus a marriage makes a whush for a while on a kintra side, and any other great thing. When people marry, and when they die, the character is sounded. Whushers and whusherings, mean whispers and whisperings. This book of mine may or may not make a whush for a little; every dog has his day; even Haggart the murderer had his:</p>

            <p>WILD SCOTS o' GALLOWA-There is now no knowing, I believe, when this term was first applied to our ancestors, nor can the reasons be properly stated why they became honoured with such a title, for an honour of the highest nature it must have been. The word "wild," in my opinion, has something grander about it than either "brave," or "noble." Indeed, it may be said to swallow up every appellation that could possibly be given to a rare warlike race; and when it was bestowed on our forefathers through a long and eventful period of the Scottish history—when every Scotchman of pith was a bowman, a sword-player, skilled in wielding the battle-axe, and quarter-staffthe epithet truly assumes a lofty character. Doubtless many a Scotchman in those ancient days, who was no Gallovidian, enlisted himself under the banner of our "wild men," merely to get amongst glorious "untame" companions; the same as now-a-days with soldiers of "spunk," they would rather be privates in the "FortyTwa," or "Auld Highlan' Watch," than officers in small fameless regiments.</p>

            <p>The situation of Galloway laid it open in these days to war in every quarter; the Southrons infested them by sea and land; and when domestic broils broke out any where in Scotland (things by no means unfrequent), the Gallovidians had a share in the fray. Such work then, as fighting, beating, and plundering foes, they doubtless well understood, and much better, it seems, than any other tribe in Scotland, as ancient books affirm; and Lord Kaims, in his writings on Scotland, says, "That in all the great battles the Scotch had with the English, the Gallwegians led the van, led the brave Caledonians on to victory; they were a race of warriors, had no fear either of hunger or death, and were called The Wild Scots o' Galloway." Just as the Highlanders now-a-days do, heading the British troops, and driving the enemy before the point of the bayonet. A writer sometime ago in the public prints, made a long harangue against "The Wild Scots o' Galloway," and seemed to have a hide "yeucking" for some Gallóvidian to start and "clawt" with a bunch of "breers;" but no one minded him; they let him fall asleep with the "lees" in his " gizzeron." I have seen nothing but two verses of poetry wrote against him, which are not so bad</p>

            <p>WRAITHS. Apparitions of a certain kind. Suppose a person in London, saw his dearest friend among the crowd, whom he was sure was living with his wife and family at the Clauchan o' Darie, in Galloway, at that same moment, then might that person in the metropolis, say he had seen a wraith. Wraiths are therefore the shadows of persons alive; they differ from ghosts, which are the shadows of persons dead. But both wraiths and ghosts are suspected to have more concerning them than a mere shadow. A ghost is always thought to appear for vengeancesake, being generally these of some wronged or murdered persons. Wraiths, on the other hand, appear as the harbingers of death, and sometimes they appear in the likeness of the person about to die, to the eye; at other times they do not appear to the sight at all, but are heard making various noises. So says superstition about these beings. For my own part, I have neither seen a ghost nor a wraith as yet, nor heard or seen any thing supernatural, that I could not in some way or other account for; but all men are not so. I have, in my Legendary Wallet, so frequently spoken of, scores of tales and stories about these and all other creatures of the same stamp, which have been often both seen and heard, and which I would now write down, did I not consider them as too tedious for a work of this description; for, although I be not a great believer in these things, I have my doubts about me, which have made me anxious, from the cradle till now, to preserve and horde up the smallest trifle respecting any thing of the kind. To speak a little farther, however, a young man with whom I am intimately acquainted, and who is never known to tell a lie, neither to me nor any other person; neither was he a believer in wraiths, nor any such beings, until the other day there. And here is the cause he gives for the alteration taking place in his belief." Last vacans (quoth he), I gaed awa to my uncle's, <pb n="483" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA483#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />or rather my granfather's, to stap a-week or twa, and</p>

            <p>play mysell amang the Moorhills; neive trouts, and learn</p>

            <p>twar three tunes on the flute; weel, I hadna been there</p>

            <p>ony time aworth, till I saw as queer a thing as ought ever</p>

            <p>I saw, or may see. Am out at the house-en ae morn-</p>

            <p>ing, about aught o'clock, and a bonny harrest morning it</p>

            <p>was, weel ye see. Am making a bit grinwan to mysell,</p>

            <p>to tak down wi' me to a deep pool that was i'the burn, fu’</p>

            <p>o' trouts, and this I was gaun to do after breakfast time,</p>

            <p>for as yet I hadna gat my sowens; weel ye sec. I'm tying</p>

            <p>on my grin wi' a bit o' wax'd thread, whan by the house-</p>

            <p>en comes my auld granfather wi' his clicked staff, that</p>

            <p>he ay had wi' him in ae han, and in the tither his auld loofie</p>

            <p>o' a mitten, which he hadna `as yet drawn on.</p>

            <p>He cam</p>

            <p>close by me, and gaed a kinn o' a luik at what I was doing,</p>

            <p>then wised himsell awa alang the hip o'e hill, to look how</p>

            <p>the nowt did, and twa young foals, as was his usual wont.</p>

            <p>Weel, awa he gaed; I was sae thrang whan he gaed by</p>

            <p>that I never spak to him, neither did he to me, and I</p>

            <p>began to think about this whan I was mair at laisure, and</p>

            <p>gaed a glent the road he tuik, just to see like how the auld</p>

            <p>body was coming on, for he was on the borders o' four</p>

            <p>score, yet a fearie fell auld carle, and as kine a body as</p>

            <p>ever I saw; sae I gaed a glent, as I was saying, alang by</p>

            <p>the scarrow o'e hill, and did see him winglan awa by the</p>

            <p>back-side o' the auld saugh Lochan. And in course o'</p>

            <p>time, maybe no ten minutes after, I stepped my waes in</p>

            <p>to see gin I could get a leap or twa o' sowens, and get</p>

            <p>aff to the trouts; whun wha think ye's just sitting on the</p>

            <p>sattle-stane at the ingle-cheek taking a blaw of the pipe—</p>

            <p>but auld granfather-Lord preserve me, said I, and said</p>

            <p>na mair; I glowr'd about me awsomly." "What's wrang</p>

            <p>wi' the boy? (quoth my auntie); come out (quo' I), and I'll</p>

            <p>tell</p>

            <p>ye, which she did. We gaed up the hill a bit, to be</p>

            <p>sure, as she said, o' the thing I had seen; we saw nought <pb n="484" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA484#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />ava, cam back again in an unco way. That vera night granfather grew ill, which was on a Saturday teen, and he was dead, puir body, or sax o'clock on Monday morning." The most of the tales I have, are from some who heard them at second hand, but the tale I have now told, was told me, as I have said, from the person who saw the wraith himself, and one whom I believe was telling the truth as nearly as any person I ever knew. Another man however, whom I give equal credit to, told me the following:-"That afore he was married, there was nae body lived wi' him i'the house ava, but twa men wha were his labourers, and helped him to work the farm; ae night thae twa cheels gaed awa a sproagin amang the lasses, and I sat up for their hame-coming till after ten o'clock; after that I gaed awa to my bed, for there were nae sines o' their coming; but whan I was stripped, and lay in my auld creevie, de'il a wink I coud sleep; I kentna what was wrang wi' me either, sae I'm lying dovering, that's neither sleeping nor waking, but atween the twa; whan the door gaed the awsomest brange I ever heard, as if somebody had struck it wi' a sledge-hammer; than I thought it was catched and shooken, as it were, a' to fliners. By this time I was on my feet, and making for't full drive, wi' an auld swoople in my neive, whan I cam till't. The door that I thought was a' in smash, is hingin on its hinges, the same way as whan I gaed lie. I open'd it mair than ance, glowr'd at it wi' the light o' the moon, and gaed out into the close, the length o' the swine-trough, but nought saw I, every thing was quiet but my heart, I thought it wad hae jumped clean out o' my brisket; lord! what wallops it gaed. In 1 cam again, pat on my claise, and waited for my men wi' the greatest anxiety. Pat about half an ounce o' tobacco in my mouth at once, sat down by the fire and whistled on the dogs about me. While sac sitting, the door gets anither brange, up I started, <pb n="485" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA485#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />but saw nothing again which I might say was the cause, and what astonished me as meikle as ought, the collies never gaed a single yelp, which, if they had heard the noise, or gin ony human had been about, wi' their gowls and bouchs wad hae been like to bring down the house. I ne'er gaed demented now, and whan the men cam hame about an hour after, they faun' me reeling about like a madman. Ane o' the bound men ay lay wi' me in my</p>

            <p>Mony a week after I</p>

            <p>bed after that until I gat the wife. thought about the noise o' the door, whan ae Sunday eve, about three months after, am reading a bit o' the bible, whan a bit neebour boy, cam ben wi' a letter, the seal being black, startled me soon I open it, and what was in it but the doolfu' account o' my brither's death, i'that terrible Jamaica Island. He haud just deed a day or twa after I had heard the unco rumling at the door, which was his wraith, nae doubts, lord be wi' him!" But to finish this article two men once told me the following:-They went into a public-house one day together, to have a bottle o' ale between them, the weather being warm; when they had the ale decanted out of the bottle, and were just taking their private "crack" together, some invisible hand struck the upper surface of the table three distinct blows, as if with a wand. Nothing on the table was injured by the strokes; the glasses in which was the ale, were not upset, nothing was deranged in point of situation, but their hearts, as they thought; up they both started and made for the door, leaving the ale undrank; in a few days afterwards they heard, to their great grief, that a dear cronie of theirs was no more; one, when they were all met together, used to sing, "Here are we met, three merry boys." I could fill a quarto volume about wraiths, and after I had done, say within myself, that I was just where I started, unable positively to prove their existence, or to deny them totally. On these things as on many <pb n="486" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA486#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />others, every man ought to think for himself. There are either something real in them, or else they are day dreams; dreams, when the person is even awake. I know the mind of man may be in this state, particularly, if a mind of fancy, or imagination, and may even be actually surprised with its own creations; the mind at this time is in a double state, one part of it, and perhaps its least, is engaged with what the hands are doing, the other is on the wild and roaming wander :</p>

WROUGHT BANES.-Sprained bones with working; how often reapers have the shackle-bane wrought in the harrest time; many a time my heart has bred to see a sweet young girl oppressed with this pain, when I had it not in my power to aid her; the best cure for it, is working it out, in the way it was wrought in; sad method, yet the best; when the bones begin to make a jirging noise, they are on the mending hand; eel-skins are bound tightly round the wrists to prevent this complaint, but I know not whether they do much good or not.</p>

WULL NICHOLSON, THE POET.-William Nicholson, the poet; such is the truth, and the pleasure I feel in saying so is of the highest kind. William certainly is a rustic bard of the first degree. Some years ago he published a little volume, which has more delighted me than many ten times its size, the beauty of a book is not in its bulk; indeed, "a great book is a great evil." His bardship wanders through the country a pedlar, and plays the bag<pb n="487" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA487#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />pipes; every body is fond of him, his cracks are extremely diverting, so humourous, yet so melancholy; as a song writer, he may rank with any but Burns; his Wild-woodside The Braes o' Gallowa-My only hope my Harry, O, and some others, are truly excellent; they have all that simplicity and genius which constitute good Scottish songs; and as a proof of their worth, they are beginning to be sung by all the peasantry; when this is the case, further praise is needless; to Fame they then go, and stand the brunts of ages unshaken. For all the songs Sir Walter hath wrote, few or none of them do this, which is certainly much against their longevity; none but a peasant can touch the feelings of the peasantry, to all others they remain impregnable. My friend William's poems are also substantial rustic buildings, his Country Lass is a dear creature, and will live at least five hundred years; the tale has plot, and is touched, if not by a master's hand, at least by an old journeyman's. Rural Retirement also is a favourite with me, particularly that verse</p>

            <p>This life's just like yon toddling burn,</p>

            <p>Tho' cross craigs whiles may stint it,</p>

            <p>Comes soughing by ilk thrawart turn,</p>

            <p>And never looks ahint it.</p>

            <p>My wish is, that he will lay down the pack for a while, and publish whatever other things in MS. he may have by him; and if he feels loath to do this, let some other one do it for him; let the world return him his cash for the pleasure he offers; the hearts of the Scotch have never been backward in approving genuine worth, and about Wull Nicholson, there is a melancholy, and an independence, that will ever cause him to be admired by true Caledonians. And should all mankind desert him, I hope he will find me never far away; whatever I can do for the good of that man, so shall it be. If I have a saxpence in the world, a part of it be his, and a word to spare, let that be said in his favour.</p>

            <p>WULLIE GRAYSON.-Those who have known a man of original character, never forget him; death may do his will with him, but memory keeps alive. A pleasure is felt when speaking of such a man, even although it would be better sometimes to padlock the tongue respecting him. When I do so about the departed Willie Gracie, properly William Grayson, I feel these sensations strong; a warmer hearted, a more humourous and manly fellow than Willie, hath seldom been known. He was a true Gallovidian, though his father Caleb came from the sister kingdom; he came, I believe, when very young, and being a tanner by trade, moreover an industrious, plodding soul, he soọn amassed as much cash as enabled him to purchase the Tannaree at Millburn, beside Kirkcudbright, where our hero, Willie, was born, Had his father, the old Englishman, not had so much cash, probably his noble-soul'd son would have yet been alive, and one of the best of human beings in Galloway. Poor fellow, the worms are now his kinsmen; yet still do we see him coming down the street of his native village, as few are seen coming, who can give one of his manly swings; there are many independent men, apparently, who seem not to cringe, and all the rest of it, at seasons. But Willie was independent always; he inherited the glorious gift directly from Nature. At all balls, baptisms, weddings, raffles, jerkins, plys, sprees, and rows of every kind, he made himself a welcome guest; and the contents of his purse he freely flashed on all occasions, yes, to the greatest extravagance. He had no fault, as the auld wives said of him, but being "warst for himsell.” His mother-wit was of the first kind, none of your Irish ginger repartee, but broad downright honest Scotch humour, similar to that possessed in such an eminent degree by the famous Robert Burns. Of mankind, he was an excellent judge; those whom he thought well of, "aue might hae rade the ford wi' at ony time," as the saying is; <pb n="489" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA489#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />yes, these persons admired by Willie, would not have deceived and led those away into deep water, who trusted in them, and there have left them to perish. Of books he was as good a critic; those he delighted to read, or those pieces of poetry he quoted; all men of a free natural disposition do the same; yet for all, ardent spirits overcame him, and he died of apoplexy when about thirty years of age. Though much given to debauchery, he was greatly respected and pitied to the last; he was much too social to do any good in this world, and the best hand at raising the wind, that perhaps has appeared this century. He would have started a merry meeting in a twinkling, on nothing, or about nothing at all; and was still Willie Gracie, whether among a party of the first-rate gentlemen, or the most ignoble of mankind; for in the course of a day, often, he would be seen with the greatest and the meanest of the land; he was just as much at his ease with the nobleman as the blackguard-still surrounded by that natural halo of worth which made him always so attractive. When in gaol for debt, as he now and then had the misfortune to be, when his father would not pay smarts and clear him out of scrapes, young ladies of the first families in the town showed much compassion for him, and either sent him books or bottles of spirits to pass away the time every day, so that the debtor's room, where he was in, was more like a place of good cheer, than a melancholy den in a prison. His favourite toast, when thus carousing in durance, was, "Here's to the King and Ma-rg-y M-1-lle, no' forgetting Sawnie Haugh and Mrs. J-lly." Those who know these characters mentioned in the toast, are the only persons who know its worth. When he was let out of gaol at one time, a gentleman met with him in the street, and after having shook him kindly by the hand, and asked how he was, began to wonder how he got to be so fat in a place of confinement. <pb n="490" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA490#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />"Wonder nothing about that, (quoth Willie) for how could I be otherwise, seeing I have been so long stall fed." Indeed, he always had on a most contented garb of flesh, and stood more than six foot high; sometimes he had his whiskers in one cut, sometimes in another; when walking about with his majestic air, his head inclined to a side a little, whiles he would dress like a sailor, and sport his huge body about in jacket and trowsers, with all the mariners in the port following in his wake. At other times he was a horse-jockey, in wide frock coat, and boots bespattered with mud: thus would he toss through the streets of the old Borough, amongst all the inns and public-houses as if he was doing an immense business; indeed he was always throng doing nothing or something less. His acquaintances were most numerous; there were some persons who knew Willie Grayson in almost every town in Britain and Ireland, and not a few, perhaps, in the Indies and the United States of America. He danced and drank at bridals with great glee, and to see his vast bulk evolving down a country dance, it inspired the whole party with mirth, for he was an excellent dancer; he could not, perhaps, like a light person, "cut double quick time," as it is called, but he was a master of "steps" of his own invention, which were much more amusing. Then he went through all the ceremonies with such a manly ease, that when he was performing them they did not seem to be ceremonies at all. Ladies and gentlemen, young and old, were all alike fond of the harmless humourous Willie Gracie. Once when he was at a dancing-school ball, where a great many young ladies were "gaun through their steps," as it is said, before their parents, an elderly lady who was sitting beside our hero, directed his attention to a young lady then dancing on the floor, and wished him to give his opinion respecting her-" Is she not just like an angel, that girl there?" said our married dame to <pb n="491" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA491#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />Willie; "I cannot say, (returned he, very serious) for I have never seen au angel yet, wherewith I might compare her," Indeed his mother-wit was of the first kind, and anecdotes of his own invention just flowed on him. Great was his humanity too; once when a hard frost had bound the river Dee with ice from shore to shore, a boy happening to slide on some weak piece when the thaw had come on, which broke from the main body, taking the poor wretch with it furiously down the stream. Grayson being on the shore, and observing the poor boy thus in the greatest danger and crying out for help, plunged in amongst the melted and melting ice, swam to him in spite of the most chilling cold, and other obstacles, and succeeded in bringing him safe to his desponding parents; what could exceed this in tenderness and natural sympathy? He was an excellent swimmer for all his vast bulk; quite a Dr. Franklin or a Byron in the water, and sometimes too, like that last-mentioned poetic personage, he would amuse himself in the water with a large Newfoundland dog. In truth, it was the largest and most strange dog I ever saw, had it not been so, it would not have been chosen by Willie for a fit companion, as every article about him was always of the oddest kind; his staffs were unmatched for shape, being always of strange wood, and of stranger forms; his snuff box, which was as large as any three of the common sort, was made after the soap box fashion, and always well filled with the best Macabaa, or with the smartest Irish Blackguard; and though he snuffed but little himself, he was not slack in presenting it to others, which he used to do with the most laughable courtesy. When the volunteers started, he took to the field with them at once, first in the cavalry, but being too weighty for his horse to carry, he left off being aid-de-camp to General Gordon, <pb n="492" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA492#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />and became a lieutenant in the infantry; respecting his horsemanship, he was one of the very best at it, notwithstanding his corpulency. Once when he was riding to the Dumfries rood fair, on a small horse he had of a white colour, called Crap, he came up with two of the sons of Erin on the road walking on foot, and, says the one to the other, while he was passing them, "Is not that, Barney, a damned fine horse?" "It is, honey, (replied his comrade) but soul, it has its load too, I think." With that horse he would ride up and down precipices at fox hunts and other occasions, which frightened good climbers on foot to attempt, for he had very little fear always about him, and was fond of hunting, both on horse and foot; and fonder of a badger or pole-cat hunt than of any other. He never was a good shot, but he always did shoot, whether the game was in reach or not; for, as he said himself, "Who knows where a blister may light?" To shoot young crows he delighted in, particularly when he had a party of people with him who had not shot many guns before, then what fun he had with their blunders; his raillery surpassed any thing for mirth, and yet was never ill taken by those whom it was pointed at. And a party always attended him of various orders, such as Nailors and half-bred Lawyers-for he generally carried with him a flask of good spirits, and plenty of cash to buy more when it began to be ebbed; he was a great friend to the spirit dealers, and would sometimes adorn the shoulders of their wives with shawls, and their bodies with gowns, and for no adulterous motive; for this crime, or for that of debauching young women, he never was blamed. His charity was of the most extensive nature; he gave-God knows what he gave away for this purpose, it was so much. Some of those poor people he gave to thanked him, others not, as the charitable ever find. An old woman once rejected a sheep's head and feet he sent her, saying, "What <pb n="493" facs="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-w9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA493#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" />use were sic things to her, unless they were sung; had Willie sent me sax pence to fill my cutty wi' tobacco, I wad hae thanked him in a different way." It was past his power to behold any being in distress and not try to ameliorate it. In short, he run his virtues into vices, by going to extremes, but he always said-" he could not help it," which was true, for he could not "owre himsell," as is said when man wants self controul.</p>

            <p>It is needless, however, to speak of his great talents or his great errors farther; those who knew him best, know well, that for his abilities they cannot be praised too much, and his vices enough execrated. Were I as he was, in somethings I have noticed in the course of this sketch, I might consider myself very clever indeed; but in other things, I hope God may keep me clear of them. Let his errors sink to oblivion though, and his excellent feelings remain amongst us while a Gallovidian exists.</p>

            <p>A friend of his, on hearing of his death, allowed his soul to break forth in these verses:—</p>

            <p>1</p>

            <p>Poor Willie Gracie, what is this of thee?</p>

            <p>Art thou gone down to doze within the grave.</p>

            <p>Art thou forsaken every merry spree.</p>

            <p>Has Death, the Tyrant, got thee made a slave?</p>

            <p>O! but he is a base, a bloody knave,</p>

            <p>To coop thee up in a cold gloomy urn!</p>

            <p>But vain it is for me at him to rave,</p>

            <p>For all my sayings he will only spurn,</p>

            <p>And laughing shout, "thou never shalt return."</p>

            <p>But can he hinder me for thee to weep?</p>

            <p>And stem the tears that down my cheeks do flow;</p>

            <p>Nay, not unless he lays me down to sleep,</p>

            <p>Like thee, poor Willie, in the dust below.</p>

            <p>For while I live and wander to and fro</p>

            <p>On this strange, mystic, silent rolling ball,</p>

            <p>My heart for thee will often beat in woe,</p>

            <p>And mourn and bleed about thy early fall;</p>

            <p>For such a man again, I ne'er shall find at all.</p>

            <entry>
                <p>YULE-BOYS-Boys who ramble the country during the Christmas holidays. They are dressed in white, all but one in each gang, the Belzebub of the corps. They have a foolish kind of a rhyme they go through before people with, and so receive bawbees and pieces. This rhyme is now a days so sadly mutilated, that I can make little of it as to what it means; but it evidently seems to have an ancient origin; and in old Scottish books I see some notice taken of Quhite boys of Zule. The plot of the rhyme seems to be, two knights dispute about a female, and fight; the one falls, and Belzebub appears and cures him. I may here give a sketch of something like the scene with the attending rhymes. Enter Belzebub, and proceeds</p>

                <p>Here come I, auld Beelzebub,</p>

                <p>And over my showther I carry a club;</p>

                <p>'And in my hand a frying-pan,</p>

                <p>Sae don't ye think I'm a jólly auld mán.</p>

                <p>Christmas comes but ance in the year,</p>

                <p>And when it comes it brings good cheer,</p>

                <p>For here are two just going to fight,</p>

                <p>Whether I say 'tis wrong or right...</p>

                <p>My master loves such merry fun,</p>

                <p>And I the same do never shun; ⠀⠀</p>

                <p>Their yarking splore with the quarter-staff,</p>

                <p>I almost swear will make me laugh.</p>

                <p>The knights enter now, dressed in white robes, with sticks in their hands, and so they have a set-to at sparring, while one of them accompanies the strokes of the sticks with this rhyme</p>

                <p>Strike then, strike, my boy,</p>

                <p>For I will strike if you are coy,</p>

                <p>I'm lately come frae out the west,</p>

                <p>Where I've made many a spirit rest;</p>

                <p>I've fought in my bloody wars,</p>

                <p>Beyond the sun, among the stars,</p>

                <p>With restless ghosts, and what you know</p>

                <p>Flock there when ere the cock doth crow;</p>

                <p>I've elbow'd thousands into hell,</p>

                <p>My ears delight to hear them yell.</p>

                <p>I've broke the backs of millions more</p>

                <p>Upon that grim infernal shore;</p>

                <p>So strike if your, a väliant knight,</p>

                <p>Or I shall knock ye down with might.</p>

                <p>Your proud insults I'll never beat,</p>

                <p>To inches I'll your body tear;</p>

                <p>If you, my love, can keep, can keep,</p>

                <p>You first must make me sleep, sleep, sleep,</p>

                <p>The second Knight now speaks, and the sparring becomes keener :</p>

                <p>Lash, dash your staff to crash,</p>

                <p>My fool, have you the water brash?</p>

                <p>If you have not, I soon shall know,</p>

                <p>I soon shall cause you tumble low;</p>

                <p>So thump away, and I shall fling</p>

                <p>Some blows on you, and make ye ring</p>

                <p>Like ye sounding belly bats,</p>

                <p>To start the music of thy guts;</p>

                <p>Or clinkers on thy hairy scull,</p>

                <p>To fell thee like a horned bull.</p>

                <p>Reel away who first shall falt</p>

                <p>Must pardon from the other call;</p>

                <p>Tho' you have fought beyond the sun,</p>

                <p>I find we'll have some goodly fun;</p>

                <p>For I have boxed in the East,</p>

                <p>To solar furnace toss'd the beast.</p>

                <p>First Knight falls, and sings out---</p>

                <p>A doctor! doctor, or I dié</p>

                <p>"A doctor, doctor, here am I."</p>

                <p>Wounded Knight sayeth—</p>

                <p>"What can you cure?"</p>

                <p>Belzebub answereth</p>

                <p>"All disorders to be sure,</p>

                <p>"The gravel and the gout,</p>

                <p>"The rotting of the snout;</p>

                <p>"If the devil be in you,</p>

                <p>"I can blow him out</p>

                <p>"Cut off legs and arms,</p>

                <p>"Join them too again</p>

                <p>"By the virtue of my club,</p>

                <p>"Up Jack, and fight a main," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

                <p>Thus a fellow is struck out of five senses into fifteen. To conclude the whole matter then, I console myself by singing this little song:-The Book personified in my Love.</p>

                <p>The wuntry sun's gane down my love,</p>

                <p>And canld lies the sna;</p>

                <p>But the spring may soon come roun' my love,</p>

                <p>And thow it a' awa;</p>

                <p>And thow it a' awa, my love,</p>

                <p>While flowers bloom out sae fair; But the blighted root will never shoot, "Twill never flourish mair.</p>

                <p>The storm delights to roar, my love,</p>

                <p>The faeming waters flee;</p>

                <p>But a calm may lull the shore, my love,</p>

                <p>And smooth the hilly sea;</p>

                <p>And smooth the hilly sea, my love,</p>

                <p>Which rows in anger sair;</p>

                <p>But the founder'd ship will never trip</p>

                <p>Alang its surface mair.</p>

                <p>Our doom is fix'd—we part, my love,</p>

                <p>Thy way is fu' o' wiles;</p>

                <p>But ay, keep up thy heart, my love,</p>

                <p>And meet the warl wi' smiles;</p>

                <p>And meet the warl wi' smiles, my love,</p>

                <p>Tho' thunders round ye rair,</p>

                <p>In darkness sweet, we yet may meet,</p>

                <p>And never sinder mair.</p>

                <p>The sun he rules the day, my love,</p>

                <p>The moon she rules the night</p>

                <p>But what doth rule thy way, my love?</p>

                <p>What guideth thee aright;</p>

                <p>What guideth thee aright, my love,</p>

                <p>On earth and sea and air,</p>

                <p>Is Chance, the Blinman, wha can dance;</p>

                <p>He's wi' thee ever mair.</p>
